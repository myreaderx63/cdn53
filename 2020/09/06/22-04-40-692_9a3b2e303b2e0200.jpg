		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>In 2011 I was commissioned by a home video label to contribute a booklet essay to its edition of Rouben Mamoulian&#39;s </em>City Streets<em>. The release was cancelled after it proved impossible to create a viable disc. I thought, since today Turner Classic Movies is showing the picture as part of its 24-hour tribute to Sylvia Sidney, it might not be the worst idea to take the essay out of mothballs, so to speak.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>“Film critics hate film historians,” a film historian and archivist told me in conversation about twenty years ago. He wasn’t bitter about it; it was his understanding that the historian and the critic had different aims. “Critics like to base their assessment hierarchies on ‘firsts.’ A great director, or an auteur, might be at least partially notable, critically, for being the ‘first’ to use extensive close-ups, or some such thing. Then a film historian discovers, or uncovers, or restores some obscure, maybe even disreputable, two-reeler serial installment by an unknown and uncelebrated director that’s replete in…close-ups. And then it’s ‘so much for that.’ If the discovery is even acknowledged by the critic in the first place, which it’s frequently not.”</p>
<p>These observations don’t <em>quite</em> haunt me as I prepare to write about Rouben Mamoulian, but I do intend to be mindful of them. The Tblisi-born one-time theater director is frequently cited as an innovator, a creator of firsts, even, in his film work, particularly his sound pictures, those made in the early (and often historically muddled, as it were) transition period between silent films and “talkies.” His melodramatic 1929 backstage musical <em>Applause</em>, starring the now-all-but-forgotten chanteuse Helen Morgan (reputedly—here we go with citing “firsts”! —the originator of the draped-across-the-piano-top singing posture) is notable not only for the relative fluidity of its camerawork—Mamoulian was one of many directors who refused to swallow the conventional wisdom that the cumbersome and sensitive new sound-recording technology, combined with the dollies and cranes and tracks used to move the camera, made a fixed, static perspective the best way to get a particular shot done—but for its fleeting location shots of New York City, in scenes wherein the film’s young lovers visit the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks. But its innovations have by now been so firmly established in mainstream film language that they can perhaps only be appreciated from the historian’s perspective; if you’re watching the picture for pleasure, it plays by turns stodgy, deliberately grotesque, moralistic and at times strangely surreal, all those qualities coming together in a striking there’s-no-business-like-show-business montage in which the film’s exemplarily pure convent-raised heroine shrinks in horror at an array of increasingly gargoyle-like chorus girls, their faces, in one garish close-up after another, looking less like mug shots than as examples from a medical textbook on deformities.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834026bde882cf1200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Sidney" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834026bde882cf1200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834026bde882cf1200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Sidney" /></a>Mamoulian’s next film, 1931’s <em>City Streets</em>,&#0160; “plays” quite a bit differently, not just because it stars two then very fresh soon-to-be-Hollywood icons, the broad-shouldered and laconic Gary Cooper, and the seriously gaminesque, ever wide-eyed Sylvia Sidney, whose career and life extended long enough for her make crucial impressions in a couple of Tim Burton films, <em>Beetlejuice</em> among them. The film boasts a scenario by another innovator, Dashiell Hammett, although truth to tell the storyline as such is both not inordinately memorable and a repository of genre tropes/conventions/clichés that moviemakers continue to fall back on today. But Hammett’s participation points to a crucial aspect of its appeal; <em>City Streets</em> is a gangster picture, and the gangster picture is a thriving or at least active genre to this day. But it’s an unusual gangster picture—an unsigned review of the film in Variety touts it as “Probably the first sophisticated treatment of a gangster picture.” This is attributable to two different styles: Mamoulian’s own personal one, and what could be called the house style of its production studio, Paramount, a house style that was more readily discernable in what’s now referred to as the pre-code era.</p>
<p>Censorship, self-censorship included was always a reality in Hollywood, but up until the adoption and imposition of a “Production Code” circa 1933 it was pretty catch as catch can. With the benefit of hindsight, cinephiles of later generations gleaned that ’33 and pre-‘33 pictures of the sound era had a looseness and brashness that can still shock naïve viewers who presume that “old” movies are by necessity priggish. The sight of a character giving the finger to a passing cab in Raoul Walsh’s rowdy <em>Sailor’s Luck</em> can elicit gasps from a contemporary audience that wouldn’t blink twice at such a thing in a current film. Again, it’s a bit reductive to make sweeping generalizations about such a substantial swath of Hollywood history, but for the purposes of this piece, let’s say that the house of Warner excelled at snappy vulgarity in gangster pictures, glitzy, often Busby-Berkeley-supervised musicals, and lurid big-city melodramas set in buzzing newspaper offices and department stores. Fox fare was a little more burly; boisterous tales of he-men on the make, as in the aforementioned Walsh picture. And Paramount, also home at the time to directors Ernst Lubitsch and Josef von Sternberg, was a little more chic, a little more soigné, a little more European. (While other versions of the quote merely specify “Paris, Hollywood,” Peter Bogdanovich cites Lubitsch telling Garson Kanin, “I’ve been to Paris, France, and I’ve been to Paris, Paramount. I think I prefer Paris, Paramount.” Lubitsch’s own journeys through “Paris, Paramount” and thereabouts are collected in the Eclipse box set “Lubitsch Musicals,” and Mamoulian himself explored that specific territory in 1932’s <em>Love Me Tonight</em>, starring frequent Lubitsch leads Maurice Chevalier and Jeannette MacDonald.)</p>
<p>This, combined with Mamoulian’s particular sense of refinement, make <em>City Streets</em> an unusual gangster picture even today. The Variety review sniffed at the picture’s “platitudinous attempt to artify beyond a desirable limit,” but again, the benefit of hindsight allowed one more recent critic to observe that <em>City Streets</em> is “composed like a tone poem.” “Composed” is indeed an apt term, and Mamoulian frequently lets Hammett’s tale—gangster’s daughter loves virtuous fella, still takes the fall for her no-good dad, fella misunderstands and becomes gangster himself while gal is in the pen, all gets straightened out (sort of) in the end—have a rest while letting run an elaborate string of nitrate notes with baroque accents. A dissolve of two close-ups of a winking Sidney; cutaways to silent, beautiful porcelain cats during an argument between a thug and his moll; the huge shadow of Guy Kibbee’s sleazy Pops oppressing Sidney’s Nan (presaged by a similar shot of a grasping baddie in <em>Applause</em>); the change of seasons seen through the imposing black bars of a prison window; the looming, then vertigo-inducingly steep staircase that becomes a veritable motif in the film’s buildup to its climax; and so much more, all gorgeously captured in silvery black and white by Lee Garmes (the only man in Hollywood that professional cynic Ben Hecht considered a&#0160; genuine artist), who also made great images for Sternberg, Hitchcock, Wyler, Ophuls, and Selznick. So near-relentless is the use of such effects that one thinks, of course, of Sternberg, but the experience of watching <em>City Streets</em> is much different than that of watching a Sternberg film, and again that word “composed” comes to mind; Mamoulian’s use of effects is much more controlled, there’s little underlying sense of delirium to it, that sense you get in certain Sternberg films that everything can go off its axis at any time and spin into sexual and moral chaos. No, Mamoulian’s more controlled, he could be Mallarmé to Sternberg’s Rimbaud, and that’s also perhaps why the pleasures of his work are more obscure. But not too obscure.</p>
<p>This is a remarkably beautiful film in so many ways, the then twenty-one year old Sidney being high among them. <em>City Streets</em> was the actress’s first film; the picture was originally meant to star silent “It” Girl Clara Bow, who was hardly the one-note performer that reductive self-proclaimed pop culture experts are inclined to categorize her as, but who nonetheless would have brought a different quality to Nan. (Bow at the time was ill and exhausted over a scandal involving her one-time business manager, and she forever regretted the loss of the role.)&#0160; Sidney’s enigmatic beauty and idiosyncratic approach to both the hard-boiled and the tragic not only provides context for but also adds dimension to Mamoulian’s flourishes; she’s an exemplary subject for his and Garmes’ cinematic brush. As for Cooper, he is at his most charming and convincing, I think not in spite of, but exactly because he’s not really required to do much of anything, except be present. His “Kid” (the convention of the nameless lead character hadn’t ossified into a pretentious affectation at this point) starts off a naïve romantic (“I used to want to be a sailor before I joined the circus”), becomes a cocky pragmatist, and finds redemption by casting away everything besides Nan and, presumably, turning back into a naïve romantic again. While the tone of <em>Applause</em> suggested that Mamoulian found that story’s young lovers fairly pro forma, is not sappy (when he’s shooting the two strolling over the Brooklyn Bridge, it’s clear he finds the bridge the most interesting character in his compositions) he clearly sees much more in Nan and the Kid, stopping the story dead almost before it’s even begun to spend several minutes (in a picture barely 80 minutes long) with them enjoying an idyllic beach stroll. Paradise is theirs for the taking, but only when they’re alone; this notion is reiterated at the film’s end, by which point the couple have cast off everything and everyone that was holding them back or keeping them apart; and they may have ended up nowhere, and nowhere may be all that is in front of them, but that’s all right with them. (Had the Production Code been in place when the picture was made, at least one of the two lovers would have been obliged to return to the slammer.)</p>
<p>Mamoulian spent the remainder of the ‘30s going from strength to strength, never settling on a particular genre or even style. He directed Fredric March in a still-convincing version of <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, an early sound horror landmark; made the aforementioned <em>Love Me Tonight</em>; guided Garbo and her longtime silent costar John Gilbert through <em>Queen Christina</em>; moved the refinement of Technicolor further along with <em>Becky Sharp</em>; and handed a breakthrough role to William Holden and an important transition role to Barbara Stanwyck with <em>Golden Boy</em>. He never forsook the theater, where he had begun directing (he staged both DuBose Hayward’s Porgy in 1927 and Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess in 1937) and the level of overt stylization he brought to his early films was largely subsumed and/or adapted by directors who could more easily acclimate themselves to being part of a studio “unit;” the very definite Mamoulian was himself fired from his last two film assignments, <em>Porgy and Bess</em> (taken over by Otto Preminger) and <em>Cleopatra</em> (given to Joseph Mankiewicz). He lived for another quarter-century after that, a repository of Old Hollywood lore, wisdom, and craft, always reminding his interlocutors of what had drawn him to film in the first place, the thing he thought it had lost: “magic.”</p>

<p>Those fleeing Spanish fascism were greeted by the fascism taking hold in France. Brecht saw that what was now taking shape no longer fit the shape of a chamber play, but rather in the landscape of <em>Dulle Griet</em>, or of the <em>Triumph of Death</em>, as Brueghel had painted them. He had the open, wide-format book brought over from a table. For a while it seemed the only thing that interested him anymore was this skeletal woman, this rural Fury who, with a frozen gaze and a gaping mouth, a breastplate over her apron and a sack full of loot slung over her shoulder, swinging her sword amidst flames and fumes, hurried through exploded cities populated by lascivious, slobbering, trunk-bearing, fishlike, reptilian beings, or that red, sandy shoreline brimming with hosts of skeletons, who, to the clang of bells, fanfares, and kettledrums, descended upon the people in amphibious wagons and other armored vehicles, in rectangular shock-troop formations behind tall shields, oozing out of bunkers, laying into them with scythes, hoes, fire tongs, pitch torches, grindstones, nets, throwing them headlong into ponds, forcing them into cages, caves, and onto the barren hills, breaking them on the wheel, beheading them, and stringing them up on rows of gallows. But suddenly he wanted to know how the Popular Front had held up in the Spanish combat zones. […] I pushed a kitchen chair toward the table, turned the book toward me, and inspected the reproductions. Almost two years earlier, in the bookstore in Warnsdorf, I had had these pictures in front of me, now, after my experiences in Spain, they emitted a new force. Often I had asked myself how it could ever be possible to convey impressions of war, since even in precise descriptions they always lost something of their essence. There was something alien that clung to the experiences being conveyed, realistic depictions were only able to cover a tiny detail, under which lay the nightmarish terror, the panicked confusion, unresolved. Here, everything was erupting from beneath the earth, enticed by the figure of Magaera. There was the swirling ash, the brittle earth, there were the tree branches withered by the heat, the demolished walls, there were the helmeted heads of the scouts beneath the shutters, there was the carnage in gateways and caves, the search for shelter beneath boulders, there was the familiar — excessively clear in every detail — and there was the brooding, the plotting; there was the phantasmagoria of deceitfulness, of betrayal, of shamelessness and disgraceful deeds; everything was equally palpable in the tumult.</p>
<p>—Peter Weiss, <em>The Aesthetics of Resistance, Volume 2</em>, 1978 (Translation: Joel Scott)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51f5ded200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Bruegeltriumph" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a51f5ded200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51f5ded200b-800wi" title="Bruegeltriumph" /></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>The Triumph of Death</em>, Pieter Brughel the Elder, 1562</span></p>
<p>He studies the tumbrel filled with skulls. He stand in the aisle and looks at the naked man pursued by dogs. He looks at the gaunt dog nibbling the baby in the dead woman’s arms. These are the long gaunt starveling hounds, they are war dogs, hell dogs, boneyard hounds beset by parasitic mites, by dog tumors and dog cancers.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>He find a second dead woman in the middle ground, straddled by a skeleton. The positioning is sexual, unquestionably. But is Edgar sure it’s a woman bestraddle or could it be a man? He stands in the aisle and they’re all around him cheering and he has the pages in his face. The painting has an instancy he finds striking. Yes, the dead fall upon the living. But he begins to see that the living are sinners. The cardplayers, the lovers who dally, he sees the kind in an ermine cloak with a fortune stashed in hogshead drums. The dead have come to empty out the wine gourds, to serve a skull on a platter to gentlefolk at their meal. He sees gluttony, lust and greed.</p>
<p>Edgar loves this stuff. Edgar, Jedgar. Admit it — you love it. It causes a bristling of his body hair. Skeletons with wispy dicks. The dead beating kettledrums. The sackcloth dead slitting a pilgrim’s throat.</p>
<p>The meatblood colors and massed bodies, this is a census-taking of awful ways to die. He looks at the flaring sky in the deep distance beyond the headlands on the left-hand page — Death elsewhere, Conflagration in many places, Terror universal, the crows, the ravens in silent glide, the raven perched on the white nag’s rump, black and white forever, and he thinks of the lonely tower standing on the Kazakh Test Site, the tower armed with the bomb, and he can almost hear the wind blowing across the Central Asian steppes, out where the enemy lives in long coats and fur caps, speaking that old weighted language of theirs, liturgical and grave. What secret history are they writing?</p>

<p><strong><em>And Hope To Die</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06e9200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="And Hope To Die" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06e9200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06e9200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="And Hope To Die" /></a>A remarkable curio. One of Rene Clement’s last pictures, it’s leagues removed from the focus and discipline of <em>Purple Noon</em>. The droll Leone pastiche in this 1972 picture’s opening railway station scene suggests something wholly other from what the movie becomes. Jean-Louis Trintignant, in Canada trying to escape from vengeful gypsies, stumbles upon what seems like a bungled caper run by, um, Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray. The dialogue soundtrack is all French, with Ray dubbing himself and Ryan, um, not. It kind of sticks out if you&#39;re accustomed to hearing Robert Ryan&#39;s voice coming out of his mouth. Ryan’s psycho leadership ethos and constant testing of Trintignant suggest James Hadley Chase, but the ostensible source material is David Goodis’ <em>Black Friday</em>. Between the dick-measuring character dynamics of the principal males and the psychodramas of molls Lea Massari and, um, Tisa Farrow, the thing mostly plays like some Claude Lelouch fever dream of existential romanticism. In the 140 minute playing time, about an hour fifty is pretty much nothing happening as the various permutations of the question of honor among thieves is considered. All of it culminating in one of the most logistically ridiculous capers I’ve ever seen in a movie, played out with a complete poker face and capped by the crane shot of Johnny LaRue’s dreams. Weirdly enough this is one of the better looking discs I’ve seen in some time, although DVD Beaver says it has a skimpy bitrate. What do I know. Stalwart Kino Lorber Kommentary Krew Howard S. Berger, Steve Mitchell and Nathaniel Thompson are appreciative, discursive, and at times informative. Inspirational tidbit: “First black guy in the film I think.” <strong>—B+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Beau Brummel</em> (Warner Archive)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47833200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Beau Brummel" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47833200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47833200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Beau Brummel" /></a>“I wonder why Stewart Granger said that <em>Scaramouche</em> was the only movie he was proud of? This doesn’t look too bad,” thought I, as I pushed this disc into the old PS4. Well I found out. Not that this 1954 picture is bad — on a ground-floor craft level it’s a solid piece of studio period product. It’s two things: Granger is bad in it. He can’t find a useful balance between his 18<sup>th</sup>-century egalitarian fop’s charisma and his arrogance, and so Peter Ustinov, as Brummel’s frenemy the future George IV, walks away with much of the film. Except when Robert Morley, as George IV’s better-known dad, shows up. And except when Elizabeth Taylor stuns in both white wig and natural raven tresses. (Granger too is always very well turned out — the much bruited russet dressing gown is a knockout.) And second, there’s the overall feeling that this is a real, albeit inadvertent, nothing-happens movie. Do I blame director Curtis Bernhard? Is it important at this point? Let the anonymous craftsman rest. Most of the time while watching this my mind reached back thirty or more years, when my boy Mel Neuhaus was running Laser Island and sold me a Japanese disc of Vincent Sherman’s 1948 <em>Adventures of Don Juan</em> with Errol Flynn and Viveca Lindfors. No great shakes as a movie per se, he said, but the best Technicolor on home video ever. And he was right. Why hasn’t Warner Archive put THAT on a Blu-ray? <strong>—B-</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Blood From The Mummy’s Tomb</em> (Scream Factory)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a5192226200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Blood" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a5192226200b img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a5192226200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Blood" /></a>Seth Holt! Aubrey Morris! Oozing amputation wounds! And Valerie Leon, who’s both the titular mummy (why did I just write that) and her modern-day counterpart, a comely lass who’s the daughter of one of the tomb raiders who unearthed the ancient Egyptian witch in the first place. Which makes things easy on the filmmakers, location-wise. Anyway. As lurid early-‘70s Hammer pictures go, this is a few smidges better than <em>Scars of Dracula</em>, no disrespect to Roy Ward Baker intended. It is a truth almost universally acknowledged that a highly attractive female lead in the vicinity of depraved murderous supernatural goings-on equals horror picture success. As a member of this movie’s core demo, I grapple with ways to verbally convey Leon’s appeal without coming off like a drooling creep out of an early Jethro Tull tune. Suffice it to say that director Holt, as we’ll even see later in this column, has a knack for satisfying the male gaze. The extras are copious and the commentary from Steve Haberman is relaxed and informative, although he himself sometimes succumbs to the temptation to drool aloud<strong>. —A</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06f3200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Bluebeard&#39;s Eighth" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06f3200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f06f3200c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Bluebeard&#39;s Eighth" /></a>I guess I understand why this 1938 picture is considered “minor” Lubitsch, all right. For me the forced absurdism of the finale slops on a — well, there’s no other word for it — jejune quality that you almost never find in the maestro’s other pictures. (The writers were Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, and Wilder’s weakness for such stuff waned soon after, and started emerging again at the very end of his career.) But the opening sequence, from its very funny shop-window gag (which Wilder fully credits Lubitsch for) to the convolutions of the meet-cute of Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert, is worth the price of admission. And Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert continue to appear throughout the whole film! Joseph McBride says “its plods tiresomely through its grating plot mechanisms” and quotes Brackett calling it “a really embarrassing picture.” (In his swell book <em>How Did Lubitsch Do It?</em>) These days though, at 90 minutes, how plodding can it be? Also: Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert. The nice-looking disc also features a commentary by Kat Ellinger that you’ll forgive me for not listening to. <strong>—A-</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>El Bruto </em>(VCI)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47857200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Bruto" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47857200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47857200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Bruto" /></a>A “major 4K restoration,” says the cover, and the picture quality of this 1952 Mexican production is very good to excellent, but still a little soft in spots. “The law is for the rich,” one of the soon-to-be-evicted tenement dwellers notes after a crowd of them receives a visit from their all-but-gloating landlord informing them of their future homelessness. Director Luis Buñuel, in the interview book <em>Objects of Desire</em>: “I added the landlord’s father” — a doddering, mordantly comical figure — “and also a scene between Katy Jurado and a rooster that I improvised during the filming,” as one does. The real gist of the picture is the Katy Jurado as the servant of the landowner, a not at all obscure object of desire. &#0160;Pedro Armendáriz is the title character, a simple oaf the landlord hires to terrorize the poor community. Two super charismatic icons of Mexican cinema facing off is pretty hot stuff to begin with, but Buñuel makes it truly special. It should be noted here nobody before or since Jurado could make a drooping lower lip so lascivious. The movie’s pace is snappy but also deliberate — the Brute and Jurado’s Paloma don’t even meet until 30 minutes into this 80 minute picture. Good old Andrés Soler is properly tetchy as the landlord. The scenario enacts the old good girl/bad girl dynamic without making you sick, because Buñuel always brings a dynamic and skewed perspective to such tropes. This is part of a VCI series of restored Mexican pictures. While they are sold as being region-free, neither this nor a second title I bought played on my PS4 (and yes I did rebuild the machine’s database after getting the error message of “invalid disc”). Played fine on my OPPO which is set to Region B. <em>Caveat emptor</em>. Otherwise, like all Buñuel, essential in any format. <strong>—A</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>Canyon Passage</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47868200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Canyon Passage" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47868200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47868200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Canyon Passage" /></a>The presentation of this 1946 Jacques Tourneur western boasts an excellent image and a professional, well-organized commentary by Toby Roan. It’s a superb, unusual film. Largely a romantic drama around a kind of love quintangle, so to speak. Not a lot of action but a load of atmosphere — look at that mud in the middle of a non-boom town’s street, and the ineffectual planks leading into the bank and the hotel. Why does Dana Andrews even bother to buy new dress boots, one wonders.&#0160; Tourneur uses a steady, observant, patiently poetic style. “It’s a beautiful film,” Martin Scorsese told Richard Schickel. “There’s a wonderful moment where Brian Donlevy is in the back room — I think Hoagy Carmichael sees him — and he’s weighing some cold out of a pouch. It’s not his. He’s just measuring it and marking the weight down. Then he looks at it again. He takes some for himself. That’s where the problem begins. He’s a decent guy, but he’s got some business problems. This kind of dilemma fascinates me.” Contrast this with the scene in <em>The Searchers</em>, over a decade later, when Ward Bond watches Dorothy Evans caress Wayne’s coat. And speaking of Hoagy Carmichael, his presence and his songs are a bonus.<strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>The Cranes Are Flying</em> (Criterion)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a519223f200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Cranes are Flying" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a519223f200b img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a519223f200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Cranes are Flying" /></a>Whoa, look at that image. The title of Chris Fujiwara’s booklet essay says it all: “A Free Camera.” Free and also beautifully focused and witnessing scenes still incredible over 60 years later. Like Tarkovsky and a few other Russians, Mikael Kalatozov’s movies can still elicit “how did they DO that?” gasps. But this love story of the Great Patriotic War (that’s World War II to us) is more than a technical tour de force, it’s an unrelentingly emotional movie. The character who dies imagining the wedding he will never have will break you. The great Ian Christie contributes a really solid video interview; there’s some material on the miracle-working cinematographer Sergei Urusevskiy; Claude Lelouch movingly recalls his discovery of the film, and bringing it to Cannes; and there’s a feature doc on Kalatozov which opens with a trumpet player in Havana playing “Nature Boy,” because <em>I Am Cuba</em>. <strong>— A+ </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Criminal</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4786c200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Criminal" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4786c200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4786c200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Criminal" /></a>The entirety of director Joseph Losey’s filmography is fascinating, but each discrete period of it is fascinating for different reasons. This 1960 movie, also titled <em>The Concrete Jungle</em> (by some distributor who wasn’t quite so clever as he reckoned, I reckon) is arguably the last in that period, which saw him, from 1947’s <em>The Boy With Green Hair</em> and into self-imposed exile from the States, finding and losing and re-finding his voice as he struggled for consistent employment. (He details those struggles in Michel Ciment’s <em>Conversations With Losey</em>, a great film book.) &#0160;It’s a tight, urgent, beautifully observed study of rank and eventually impotent masculinity and the second film of Losey’s alliance with Stanley Baker. (The alliance with Dirk Bogarde began with <em>The Sleeping Tiger</em> six years prior. Baker and Bogarde would Losey-meet in 1967’s <em>Accident</em>, also a recent Kino Lorber release I did not review because it’s essentially the same as the BFI Blu-ray with fewer supplements.) &#0160;Losey’s depiction of prison, both visually and thematically, is striking. The cinematographer was Robert Krasker, and while his work here is not as consistently pin-sharp as in <em>The Third Man</em> (which I believe is at times deliberate), it’s very good. (The prison-door peephole effect is a little janky, but it’s 1960, come on.) The staging of the prison riots is something. Patrick Magee does some possibly unexpected underplaying as a prison guard. And Baker’s man outside for a new criminal endeavor is played by Sam Wanamaker, for all you wanting to do some further research into the universe of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. I’ve enjoyed Kat Ellinger’s commentaries on certain films but here her contribution did not send me. In a scene set in the prison chapel, she observes that here the men are “united by another oppressive force, by the church.” In any event, this is a helluva movie. Very influential, I think, in a kind of stealth way, on Scorsese’s crime pictures and on Fargo. Also the John Dankworth/Cleo Laine musical contributions are faboo. Did you know that my mom’s lawyer represented those two in the States? Now you do. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day of the Dolphin</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f070f200c-pi" style="float: left;"> </a><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0715200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Day of Dolphin" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0715200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0715200c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Day of Dolphin" /></a><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f070f200c-pi" style="float: left;"></a>Looks spectacular. <em>Is</em> spectacular. This movie got a lot of smack when it was released in 1973, and it didn’t do well, but looking at it now, you can see director Mike Nichols doing a sketch blueprint for <em>E.T.</em> The long tracking shots, the mysterious montages building to a reveal, and more, are key components of a cinematic idiom designed to elicit Ye Olde “Sense Of Wonder.” But the dolphin voices just don’t do it the way Spielberg’s creature did, you may say. Well I LIKE the dolphin voices. (Which were provided by the late Buck Henry, also the movie’s screenwriter. I kind of regret not asking him to do one for me the single time I met the great man.) The Berger/Mitchell/Thompson commentary is typically enthusiastic and garrulous, albeit a little far-fetched; the fellows interpret this as a movie about a director being manipulated and thrown away by the studios, and compare to De Palma’s <em>The Fury</em>, positing that Andrew Stevens’ character in the latter film is a stand-in for De Palma and...well you get the idea. I think. I’m not exactly sure I do myself. <strong>—A-</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>Dodsworth</em> (Warner Archive)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47873200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Dodsworth" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47873200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47873200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Dodsworth" /></a>“The best. The best.” I remember my old friend the film historian Ed Hulse characterizing this 1936 William Wyler picture thusly many moons ago, back when it was way harder to see. He’s right, and his opinion is not a minority one among his and our ilk. Which is kind of interesting to consider these days, because this adaptation of a Sinclair Lewis novel is a quiet, deliberate, nuanced character study that’s only a few steps on the other side of the Art Film border. This Warner Archive disc presents a 2019 Film Foundation restoration that is not merely a restoration but a revelation. Rudolph Maté’s cinematography is every bit as sensitive as Wyler’s direction and the three lead player, Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton, and Mary Astor give career best performances that you can now view with startling clarity. The soundtrack is well cleaned up too. A master class in classical cinematic language, particularly with respect to framing (not to mention pacing).&#0160; he black telephone at Astor’s villa is a nifty precursor to the box in Wyler’s 1941 <em>The Little Foxes</em> Inspirational dialogue: “They say we’ll have to behave ourselves when we become a couple of old grandparents in December.”<strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>ffolkes</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>

McLagen. And bringing David Hedison along for the ride. (That makes it sound as if the participation of a Felix Leiter was deliberate, and I can’t REALLY say it was.) Here he’s a very unorthodox undersea rescue strategist called upon by a skeptical British government to prevent Anthony Perkins and Michael Parks and their pals from blowing up an oil rig. Moore’s character’s unorthodoxies include excessive cat coddling, a misogyny that truth to tell is expressed relatively mildly (he’s irritated at having been brought up with only sisters, or something), and swigging whisky straight from a bottle which winds up being the trait that registers most vividly. Action movie cultist comfort food to be sure. &#0160;Another good looking disc, especially color-wise. But not all that robustly cinematic. Can’t really complain though. <strong>—B</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Hard Ticket To Hawaii</em> (Mill Creek)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f071d200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hard Ticket" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f071d200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f071d200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Hard Ticket" /></a>I have more than once related my conversation with director Andy Sidaris during a screening of this 1987 film, one in which he complained that the fellow sitting in the row ahead of me (whom I did not admit to actually knowing) were giggling too much. On the introduction to this disc, recycled from the <em>Guns, Girls, and G-Strings</em> DVD box set, statuesque scream queen Julie Strain, rest in peace, says to Sidaris of the picture, “It just cracks me up every time.” Why doesn’t Sidaris object when SHE says she finds it funny? I think we all know why. Anyway. This is a true classic of the let’s-discuss-this-case-nude-in-the-hot-tub subgenre of action thriller, the one featuring the giant uncontrollable poisonous snake. It is, as a production, WAY slicker than 1985’s <em>Malibu Express</em>. If you’re keeping score. Weirdly enough, given the purposefulness of most Sidaris fare, this meanders a bit. As if he wants to put off the ultimate snake reveal but he doesn’t have enough plot to manage. <em>MST3K</em> people take note: &#0160;Flying a small plane is to this movie what rock climbing was to 1951’s <em>Lost Continent</em>. While I miss Barbara Edwards and Susan Kiger from earlier films (blame it on my dad’s stash of <em>Playboy</em> mags), Dona Speir and Hope Marie Carlton bring what they bring with aplomb. And then there’s that classic Frisbee gag. Inspirational dialogue: “I’m supposed to be soft, I’m a woman.” Inimitable Sidaris comedy: “You tried to rape me last night!” “That was yesterday!” Inimitable Sidaris suspense: One of the girls takes a Polaroid and as she’s holding it up says, “Look, it’s developing!” The instantly memorable theme song is even “better” than I remembered: “It’s not paradise all the time,” verily. Image quality is fine, and the audio commentary features immortal banter between Andy and his wife and producer Arlene. Andy: ”Here comes a great joke,’ She’s so dumb she had to go home and study for her pap test.’” Arlene: “That was your joke Andy. I will never take credit for it. Ever.” They also wax amazed that they managed to credibly cut together footage shot in L.A. and Molokai, holy shit. Ultimate inspirational dialogue: “One man’s dream is another man’s lunch.” <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>House By The Cemetery</em> (Blue Underground)</strong></p>

A little later: “Fulci and women is one of those problematic topics,” okay, I guess that’s more like it. But the thing is, if I were worried about things being problematic, I wouldn’t watching a Lucio Fulci movie. I don’t want to drag Haworth too much, as I’ve got a Bluray with my own commentary on it coming soon. (Fortunately said disc’s commentary, on Ford’s <em>The Long Gray Line</em>, in a box from Indicator, also features Farran Smith Nehme and Diana Drumm, who are great, and make me look and sound better.) For the most part here he’s informal but informative, and occasionally understated, as when he observes “<em>Amityville Horror 2 </em>has some incestuous things in it.” SOME? This remastering has a very strong teal color correction. This practice is controversial, and I’m curious as to why this 1981 grindhouse item got this treatment. Its coolness complements the movie well, as it turns out, at least to my eye. As Fulci stuff goes, this is rather understated — nobody vomits up their own intestines or anything — and concentrates on creepy don’t-go-into-the-basement set pieces. The other extras are in the delightful Blue Underground &#0160;deep-dish tradition, and there’s a CD of the soundtrack for those delighted by mysterioso organ chords and such. <strong>—A</strong></p>

It looks magnificent and until there’s a 4K disc this will stand as the ultimate home theater version of John Stahl’s magnificent broad-daylight noir with Gene Tierney magnificently playing against simpatico siren type to contrive and ice-cold selfish spider. This loses the 2005 commentary (recycled on the TT disc) that Richard Schickel did with supporting player Dwayne Hickman, which is a shame. But in a video interview Imogen Smith contributes a relatively thorough &#0160;examination of Stahl, well-organized and revealing. Citing Stahl’s restraint, she compares him with Naruse which is a sharp observation.<strong>—A</strong></p>

Anyway, I think I was being kind of a dick about it. Not to say that the strained allegory suddenly holds up…but its points seem rather more salient now for some reason. In any event, the star-studded procession certainly qualifies as A Unique Object. Digitally shot, it looks more so here than I recollect it looking back in the day. And the extras help in making sense of the whole thing: Co-writer and director Larry Charles (who got to know Dylan via factotum Eddie Gorodetsky, who Charles claims was boring Larry David so much on a plane trip that Charles jumped in to engage him to spare Gorodetsky potential humiliation) recalls the project’s conception as a “Bob Dylan slapstick comedy.” He also complains about the reviews. Sorry Larry! <strong>—A-</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Oscar</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>

Co-screenwriter Harlan Ellison was so upset by the end result of this crazy crawl-your-way-to-the-top saga (although it is in fact replete with Ellisonean overstatement) that he used to mount a yearly <em>Oscar </em>Renunciation Tour, or something. Long elusive in terms of decent home versions, this is indeed a superb restoration. Jill St. John actually looks a little TOO peaches and cream, if such a thing is possible. Poor Tony Bennett. Anyway. The disc is equipped with two commentaries. The first features Patton Oswalt, Josh Olson (yup, the guy who said he won’t read your &quot;<a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/09/09/i-will-not-read-your-fucking-script/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fucking script&quot; </a>although maybe he’s got time now) and Eric Nelson (director of the Ellison documentary <em>Dreams With Sharp Teeth</em>). They enact an approximate <em>MST3K</em> riff session interspersed with gossip and much Ellison appreciation — they all knew the man. There are some good zingers. “Is he married to The Polyphonic Spree?” being one. Along the way the fellow reveal that they don’t know who Guy KIbbee was. No wonder movies suck nowadays. The other commentary features Berger, Mitchell and Thompson, who protest, re the movie’s alleged poor quality, “Audiences ENJOY this!” and at some point work in a comparison to <em>The Best Years of Our Lives</em>. One notes, “I watch this movie and I see one big similarity with one director and that’s Martin Scorsese.” These dudes are high as fuck. Eventually one of them descends sufficiently to make the more apt comparison, which is with Aldrich’s <em>The Legend of Lylah Claire</em>. Was the Jean Hale character truly based on Carroll Baker? We may never know. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Penelope</em> (Warner Archive)</strong></p>

The movie is not quite the embarrassment that its poster, reproduced on the front of this Bluray, is, but that’s not saying much. Wood who is lovely and charming, plays a well-kept wife who’s not so well-kept that she won’t rob her husband’s bank to work out some neurotic kinks. Ostensible comedic highlights include attempted rape by Jonathan Winters and Dick Shawn as a shrink. The move maintains interest from a standpoint of sheer curiosity, although I cannot lie,&#0160; the lead performer running around in her underwear doesn’t hurt. She also sings. There’s a nifty 360 degree dolly shot (thank God for Harry Stradling Sr., the cinematographer later beloved by Barbra Streisand), nifty location scenes in MOMA’s sculpture garden, Peter Falk working out his Columbo mannerisms, Ian Bannen totally at sea, and a lot of hair and costume changes. Also a wacky twist ending. As Candice Bergen remarked to Paul Schrader re <em>American Gigolo</em>, “The colors are wonderful.” <strong>—B</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Pray for the Wildcats</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>

It’s a made-for-TV movie, how can he be a “guest star?” This is one of the recent Kino releases that touts a “Brand New 2K Master” and makes you ask, “why this and not <em>Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife</em>?” &#0160;But wow, it really DOES look good. This is the third time I’ve seen this. The first was when it aired on ABC as a “special” (there’s that word again) “two hour event” or what they called it. It was pretty weird seeing nice Andy Griffith (I’d never seen <em>A Face In The Crowd</em>, whaddya want from me, I was 15) as a psycho exec inveigling some ad agency stooges to go dirt-biking with him, on a journey where he eventually kills a couple of hippies. Aiieeee. Griffith overplays when he’s taking off his motorcycle helmet, for Christ’s sake. Even more special than Reed is William Shatner, who throughout delivers the Most Shatner Line Readings Ever. The second time I saw it was in the late 90s with a bunch of drunk/high as fuck bar buddies during a marathon viewing that also included that Powers Boothe Jim Jones movie. And now, in sobriety, it remains almost if not quite as uproarious as ever, in part because the picture got its two-hour ABC time slot through padding. And the padding consists of, well, dirt biking, doled out in rock-climbing portions. Commentators Amanda Reyes and Bill Ackerman do not riff on the movie or find it in any way hilarious. Instead, they &#0160;take it quite seriously, which I suppose is to their credit. Apparently academia is beginning to catch up with TV movies, as they cite at least one study. Neat. They’re very informative — although it’s clear that Ackerman read the same Wikipedia entry on score composer Fred Myrow that I did. Said score is pretty creditable in fact. Did I mention Marjoe Gortner? This is his first post-<em>Marjoe</em> acting gig, and he’s not great. Supporting females Lorraine Gary, Janet Margolin and OF COURSE Angie Dickenson (who utters the immortal title) look very displeased to be here. <strong>—B+</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong><strong><em>Quai des Orfevres</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>

In a sense this is a feature rather than a bug; <em>Quai</em> is a city tale located in differing milieus while <em>Corbea</em>u’s murderous provincials motored a story that was almost immediately tight as a noose. But this movie gets there. Bernard Blier is the sad sack married to luscious Suzy Delair (who only just died at the age of 102!) who might be looking for a sugar daddy in old Charles Dullin. Soon someone ends up dead and Louis Jouvet’s inspector shows up. Much devious character is revealed, Clouzot times kettles to boil over at thematically opportune times, and the whole thing builds to a brutal ending. Clouzot’s mastery (some would say facility) is more than fully formed here. My friend Nick Pinkerton flies solo for a long commentary and comes through with, well, flying colors. And the movie itself looks great. <strong>—A</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>A Quiet Place In The Country</em> (Shout Factory)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0874200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Quiet Place In The Country" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0874200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0874200c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Quiet Place In The Country" /></a>The slight raggedness of the materials used to master this disc is a bit of a plus. Makes the movie look even more disreputable, so to speak. But what, you may ask, is Vanessa Redgrave doing in a disreputable movie? Neither giallo nor pure art picture, <em>Quiet Place</em> is a 1968 picture directed by Elio Petri (who cowrote the script with Tonino Guerra) and costarring Redgrave’s then-mate, Franco Nero. Nero plays a tortured artist tormented (or is that the word) by dreams of his lover/agent (Redgrave, natch) dominating him violently while dressed in S&amp;M gear. They hit upon the title residence, she leaves him to his own devices, and he starts going even more insane. Good color values. A messy, weird movie that recalls a bunch of others from this time frame while not really resembling them. (I thought of <em>The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh</em> once and then said, “Nah.”) The color values of the presentation are solid and the Troy Haworth commentary is one of his better one, at least that I’ve heard. My friend Dan Callahan, in his biography of Redgrave, calls her role “essentially thankless,” which is fair enough. Unless Redgrave got a lot out of dressing in S&amp;M gear. One hopes so. <strong>—B</strong></p>

And whatever you think it’s gonna be based on that, it’s not. As commentators Steve Haberman, Constantine Nasr, and Ted Newsom point out, Sharp didn’t have enough dough for lavish scenes, the result of having 20,000 pounds cut from the budget. Hence, you don’t get a lot of the splendor of the Czar’s court. Really it’s mostly Christopher Lee’s Rasputin causing trouble in bars. You laugh (I hope) but I kid you not. (The commentary as a whole is mostly excellent but the fellow occasionally nod [one of them pronounces the great director’s name “VIncenty Minnelli”] or go out on weird limbs [“Rex Reed complained of Myra Breckinridge that his dance was not cut properly”]. They do display a lot of expertise on various refitted Hammer sets (one bar once was Dracula’s basement). There’s an original cast commentary too, featuring Lee, which of course is older. Once you become accustomed to the movie’s ontological reality, it’s kind of fun — there’s some super nasty acid-throwing stuff in the climax, if that’s your bag — and the image quality as a whole is splendid.<strong>—A-</strong></p>

<p>Given the very particular standard set by MGM in the 1940s and beyond you may wonder, how good can a Universal-produced musical in black-and-white made in 1936 be. Holy moley, do you have a treat in store. Never doubt James Whale is all I can tell you. It looks superb and perhaps more crucially it sounds better than fine. The picture does have a side which many may consider stodgy, most of it residing in its hewing in some respects, to theatrical musical conventions of the time. But once you get accustomed to that it adds to the fascination. The performers are incredible. Helen Morgan! Paul Robeson! Irene Dunne in general but also her what-the-fuck-is-going-on dance during “Can’t Help Loving That Man.” Whale’s direction is &#0160;consistently excellent; there are moments of fascinating Whale Expressionism in “Old Man River” and the imagery during “I Have The Room Above Her” (a song composed especially for the film, one of three) is stunning. The extras are superb. They include excerpts from the 1929 <em>Show Boat</em>, originally silent, rewired for sound &#0160;and also featuring Helen Morgan, and a Paul Robeson doc from 1979, narrated by Sidney Poitier. (This is also a feature of Criterion’s Robeson box set.) There’s also a new video feature on the movie’s race issues, as navigated by scholar Shana L. Redmond. She asks viewers to interrogate what “makes us comfortable” about a number of its tropes and depictions. As much as I admire <em>Show Boat</em>, I’ve never been comfortable with it in that respect. Rather, I adore it largely because of the songs, their incredible melodies and quietly spectacular lyrics. People like to slag Oscar Hammerstein II but any guy who can come up with a couplet like “I’m tired of living/and scared of dying” has definitely got something on the ball. Many of you might not remember that this was, a long time ago, a Criterion laser disc (spine number 45) and the company has included my old <em>Video Review </em>colleague Miles Krueger’s professional, polished, informative commentary from that edition. An incredible package. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> (Arrow)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0881200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Slaughterhouse" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0881200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f0881200c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Slaughterhouse" /></a>I saw this movie when it first came out in 1972, at the age of twelve. I had read the novel. As you can imagine I was an incredibly popular kid. Anyway, I convinced my mom’s younger brother to be my adult guardian; he was (and remains) twelve years my senior, and I do think he enjoyed the movie, largely due to Valerie Perrine. I would have my grandmother take me to see <em>Frenzy</em> later in the year and that did not go nearly as well, by which I mean it did not go well at all. I don’t know what my point is except to underscore that both the novel and the film are art objects I have long held dear. So I’m quite glad to see this on Bluray, in an excellent transfer. Kurt Vonnegut loved this adaptation and I can understand why — it gets within better than swinging distance of the novel’s tone despite (wisely, I think) jettisoning completely its mantra, “And so it goes.” I know it’s flawed and its portrayals of women are bad, although I’d argue that Vonnegut and the movie were pushing the stereotypes and cultural conventions that were part of the reality of American suburbia of the time, but we can argue about that later. The performances are all good to great, the structuring is masterful, the physical editing lives up to the concept behind the structuring (and almost never goes for cheap correspondences), and so on. With <em>The World of Henry Orient</em>, it’s director George Roy Hill’s greatest achievement. The editorial supplements, I’m sorry to say, abound with examples of Not Getting It. The commentary is by Troy Haworth, who kicks off by explaining he’s interested in this movie, since he’s usually more into “European stuff.” He then says that Glenn Gould “composed” the score. Glenn Gould was not a composer. The score was composed by Bach. It’s “European stuff.” &#0160;He’s very good on the cast, except when he says of Perrine, “we’re going to be seeing a lot more of her and I do mean a great deal more of her.” But man, he has a true millennial (at least I suppose it is that) appreciation of what World War II was all about, and almost constantly complains of how passive and uninteresting Billy is, without taking much note of his, um, name. More disappointing is the stalwart Kim Newman, who doesn’t seem to understand that the movie is about the dislocation of PTSD and instead wonders whether Vonnegut had seen <em>Last Year At Marienbad</em>. Maybe he had, but one doubts that had anything to do with anything. What Vonnegut did in his book was pinpoint the shattered reality of what Tom Brokaw would corrupt into “the greatest generation.” When Billy’s wife, wishing to know who gave Billy the jewel that he has put into a piece of jewelry for him, asks “What was his name Billy?” and we know his name was Edgar Derby and we know how he died and Billy won’t say but Billy keeps looping in and out of the event forever…I mean how dense do you have to be to get that this isn’t about Resnais? Or rather, that Resnais himself was often about the same thing? (You, he and I have all seen <em>Muriel</em>, no?) Newman also glibly dismisses “And so it goes” as words “of wry acceptance.” Seriously man. After a while I was almost shouting at the television: “IT’S ABOUT PTSD IT’S ABOUT PTSD IT’S ABOUT PTSD.” Anyway, the interview with Perry King is good. He’s superb in the movie, one of his best appearances. He at one point characterizes the film as perhaps “too gentle” and maybe that’s not a bad call. &#0160;It’s still great. <strong>—A</strong></p>
<p><em>&#0160;</em><strong><em>Song of Songs</em> (Kino Lorber)</strong></p>

It’s a strange world. The image is mostly fine and hey, the movie is 90 years old. Soft at times. Lots of grain but it’s well-structured as they say. Sometimes a shimmer effect. All of it is superbly transferred. The movie presents a small but determined spider’s web of male perverts trapping the devout Dietrich. Sculptor Brian Aherne convinces her to pose nude for him, and perhaps he can provide the kind of love Dietrich dreams of, the kind spoken of in the title scripture. The resultant sculpture is pretty racy, because it was 1932. Instead of being a true amour, Aherne then pimps her to kinky military faux alpha Lionel Atwill. Mamoulian’s touch is not as clever as what he wielded in his prior <em>City Streets </em>(though the change of tone is appropriate to the ostensible tragedy of the melodrama) but his mastery is pretty impressive nonetheless. Because it’s Mamoulian the swoony stuff gets close to actual sensuality and the cheesy stuff has a consistently compelling quality. David Del Valle’s commentary is pertinent and informative but he is prone to overexcitement at times. “Look at those nipples!” he exclaims of the sculpture. Yup, there they are. Tom Milne, in his great monograph on Mamoulian, argues that the last third of the melodrama calls for a director with Stroheim’s sense of cruelty, and that “wielding the scalpel has never been Mamoulian’s forte.” Be that as it may, a few blows register. Highly worthwhile. &#0160;<strong>—A-</strong></p>

This 1969 Western is a modest but incredibly solid construction, featuring &#0160;great, great cinematography by Charles Lang, spectacularly transferred here. Gregory Peck, who’d worked with Mulligan before in 1962’s <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em>, iyou may have heard of it, is inspired while conspicuously narrowing his register. The underplaying of his tracker character makes him an enigmatic hero but not an anti-hero, as was often the fashion with American Westerns of the time. Eva Marie Saint, as the woman he protects, is a perfect mysterious foil for him. The direction of this suspenseful long-term chase drama is perfectly judged, superb, understated, but also brutal on occasion.&#0160; As a character study and a tense cat-and-mouse, it’s still pretty unbeatable.<strong>—A</strong></p>

This 1963 number, often cited as a perverse favorite by Martin Scorsese (it was included in a double feature program he and Jay Cocks curated for Film Forum last summer, where I finally saw it for the first time) is a super-squinchy bit of business that begins as a mucky men at work melodrama. Specifically the men are post-war Germans and Brits (with Mario Adorf as a brute of not credibly specified ethnicity) pitted together and against each other at a Saharan oil-pumping station. So it’s already a little tense. These grimy fellows (among them Denholm Elliot at his least ingratiating and an insufferably loutish Ian Bannen, who we last spoke of in the <em>Penelope</em> capsule, and irritable as he is he makes a bigger impression here than there) get monthly visits from a van load of sex workers, but that hardly suffices to quell their passions. On to the scene crashes (literally) Carroll Baker, and it’s off to the races. Seth Holt, who we last spoke of in the <em>Blood From The Mummy’s Tomb</em> capsule, compels Baker (who we last spoke of in the <em>The Oscar</em> capsule) to tease the camera with everything she’s got, down to her little toe. The fellows, especially ultra-Teuton Peter Von Eyck (even slimier here than in <em>The Snorkel</em>, which we have not spoken of, and here he doesn’t even murder anyone), all start to lose it, and badly. Just when you think things couldn’t get more skeevy, they kind of do, and the jaw-dropping ending does adhere to a certain logic, one not just misogynist but committedly misanthropic. The image quality is sometimes a little soft and there are no extras but I’m just glad to finally have a copy with which to Amaze My Friends. And I just found out the thing is some kind of <em>remake</em>? I must look into that. <strong>—A-</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Straight On Till Morning</em> (Shout Factory)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47981200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Straight On" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47981200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f47981200d-100wi" style="width: 80px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Straight On" /></a>A Hammer picture I hadn’t heard of before, directed by Peter Collinson, who made <em>The Italian Job</em>. This isn’t nearly as funsy. Dotty Rita Tushingham, too long sheltered by a cranky mom, strikes out on her own in not-quite-so-swinging-as-it-recently-had-been London (the picture was made in 1972). Where she soon runs afoul of Shane Briant’s Peter, whose look clearly inspired the Linus Roache character in Pan Cosmatos’ <em>Mandy</em>. (Or maybe not. I should never presume. But I’d bet money on it.) The movie is very “hip” in its cinematic language — a lot of ping-ponging flashbacks and flash forwards, interior monologues, dislocation stuff, not inappropriate for the psychotic character we eventually learn Peter to be. But the movie also uses it with some other random characters, which is kind of pointless and show-offy. It builds to a thoroughly icky conclusion after being vaguely distasteful throughout. The disc looks fine. The commentary with Tushingham and Jonathan Sothcott&#0160; (author of <em>The Cult Films Of Christopher Lee</em>) was recorded around 2002,&#0160; first heard on the Anchor Bay DVD of that year. For Hammer completists only, and might make you regret being a Hammer completist. <strong>—B</strong></p>
<p><em>&#0160;</em><strong><em>The Tall Men</em> (Twilight Time)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51923e5200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Tall Men" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a51923e5200b img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51923e5200b-100wi" style="width: 80px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Tall Men" /></a>Seems like this is one of the final releases from a really remarkable label; I suppose that co-founder Nick Redman’s death last year put it to an end. This release is just one reason I’ll miss it. It’s a gorgeous, engaging 1955 Raoul Walsh Western, beautifully transferred with no extras save a typically astute essay by Julie Kirgo. Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell are ex-Confederate cowboys drifting toward would-be cattle baron Robert Ryan. The three form an uneasy alliance for a big cattle drive, with Jane Russell complicating matters. The pace is relaxed, with tension rising and releasing; when payoff times come, they’re delivered with power. Mitchell’s character is particularly moving. Good script by two pros, Frank Nugent and Sydney Boehm. Really beautiful and sensitive use of widescreen and color, handled by Lee Tover, who also did <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and <em>The Heiress.</em> Durable score by Victor Young, which, as is standard practice on Twilight Time titles, featured on an Isolated track. The devotion of the Mexican <em>vaqueros</em> to Gable’s character is a nicely understated theme here. &#0160;And because Walsh is Walsh, the movie’s occasional corn isn’t just tolerable, it plays. Pretty great.&#0160; —A</p>
<p><strong><em>Teorema</em> (Criterion)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f089c200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Teorema" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f089c200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f089c200c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Teorema" /></a>The BFI Blu-ray from 2013 has a teal-leaning color correction that was not complained about at the time; this transfer just pushes it harder. Again, as with Criterion’s <a href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2019/01/so-at-the-end-of-every-year-i-rearrange-my-computer-desktop-folders-for-freelance-work-scr-work-and-more-go-on-to-an-exter.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Midnight Cowboy</em></a> it looks better than fine in motion, and in still frames too. I suppose this is a matter of taste, but I do wonder about honoring directorial/cinematographic intent. I realize too that now might not be an opportune time to try to do any reporting on it. So I’ll just continue to say how pleasing I find this edition. The new master has real improvement in the overall picture with respect to detail, evident in the early sepia sequence. Also look at Laura Betti’s eyes when she first sees Stamp’s character. A deep pleasure to watch, I found. The BFI picture is harder edged, more contrast heavy, almost antiseptic. Bad Pasolini, crediting Mozart but not Ted Curzon, whose “Tears For Dolphy” plays under the opening titles. Shame!&#0160; The Robert Gordon commentary notes this, and good for him. I had not listened to this commentary on the BFI edition and I have to say it’s first-rate. Peter Cowie-level. Fun fact: &#0160;Lee Van Cleef and Orson Welles had been considered for the Stamp role, which would certainly have brought different discrete stresses to the allegory. &#0160;Essential cinema. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 1</em> (Warner Archive)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4798b200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Tex Avery" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4798b200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f4798b200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Tex Avery" /></a>I love Tex Avery and think he was a genius but let’s face it: the boisterousness of his humor walked hand in hand with something of a mean streak. You all know what I’m talking about: “Miss Repulsive 1898” in <em>Swing Shift Cinderella</em> (not included in this set but available on Blu-ray in a <em>Looney Tunes Platinum</em> collection), the repeated gag of a veil lifted from a shapely woman’s face to reveal pimples, buck teeth and so on, that sort of thing. In <em>Big Heel Watha</em> the title character is such a spectacularly offensive milquetoast grotesque aside from the ostensible racial stereotype that the racial stereotype kind of becomes a non-sequitur. Which doesn’t make it less objectionable. Just more…confusing. One senses that Avery was aware his own pigtail-pulling sadism, but not with any kind of regret. Indeed the entire idea behind the Screwball Squirrel character was to be purposefully almost intolerably obnoxious. This magnificent set includes the entirety of the Screwball Squirrel series and it’s also remarkably, manically inventive, every bit reminding you that the excess is the point (I especially like the multiple-doors chase in <em>The Screwy Truant</em>). In the less problematic areas (boy does that well-worn Warner disclaimer at the front of this program have its work cut out for it) there’s the magnificence of<em> Red Hot Riding Hood</em>. One gag therein practically invents the jump cut, while the sight of the wolf hitting himself on the head with a hammer while looking at Red makes one wonder if Avery also invented the “run me over with a truck” meme. <em>Batty Baseball</em> is extra radical,&#0160; <em>Bad Luck Blackie</em> incomparable, and so on. No extras, beautiful transfers, Volume 2 can’t come quick enough. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Tiger of Eschnapur/The Indian Tomb</em> (Film Movement)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08cb200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Tiger of Eschnapur" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08cb200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08cb200c-75wi" style="width: 75px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Tiger of Eschnapur" /></a>I’ve <a href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2015/08/fritz-lang-and-pierre-menard.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">written extensively</a> on this movie before so I’m doing a brief capsule here just to say this version looks fantastic. The package retains the excellent David Kalat commentary from a prior standard def release. And adds Mark Rappaport’s excellent <em>Debra Paget, For Example</em>, which opens with the question “Why Debra Paget?” &#0160;To which the answer is “Why not,” but indeed, there’s more to it than that. <strong>—A+</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Wheels on Meals</em> (Eureka!, Region B import)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f479a5200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Wheels on Meals" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4f479a5200d img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4f479a5200d-100wi" style="width: 80px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Wheels on Meals" /></a>“Dad’s in with a nervous breakdown. He flipped! It’s really complicated.” The “Classic” English dub of this rollicking 1984 comedic martial arts picture really is, as the description in the jacket list of features says, “funkier” than the other audio options. Starring Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, and director Sammo Hung, and shot in Barcelona because by this time the three were so famous that shooting in Hong Kong became a logistical nightmare, this nonsensical tale is replete with lowbrow humor concerning mental institutions, mental health, the homeless, sex workers and more. It’s all so breezily tossed off, though, and the conditions as depicted have so little to do with real life that one just rolls one’s eyes and waits for the next bit of action. Which is all fabulous. The 2K master looks swell, the extras, mostly imported from a version of the movie released via the Hong Kong Legends label are enjoyable and informative and, suitably I’d say, hardly formidable.<strong>—A</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Whisky Galore/The Maggie</em> (Film Movement)</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08d6200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Whisky Galore" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08d6200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3f08d6200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Whisky Galore" /></a>Film Movement has been doing stalwart work in the Bluray department recently. Their releases of the more obscure but reliable delightful old Ealing pictures such at <em>The Titfield Thunderbolt</em> are exemplary. Of course I was especially tickled to get this, a double feature generously put on a double-disc set. <em>Whisky</em>, also known as <em>Tight Little Island</em>, is of course the directorial debut of Alexander Mackendrick. &#0160;The story is of Scotch-starved Scots (WW II rationing, you see) who have the good fortune of having a ship carrying a large cargo of the stuff go down off their coast. It’s a very droll comedy with a bit of bite, something Mackendrick could always deliver. The disc is a good transfer from a good piece of material; I should say good rather than great. Every now and then, particularly in exterior shots, it looks a little dupey but it’s not too distracting. The commentary is by John Ellis also the producer of a good documentary on the film that’s included in the package. He knows his stuff, and he interacts with the actual soundtrack in a way that’s unusual for commentaries. There is a good deal of purposeful esoterica here: descriptions of the perspectives on religion in the Compton Mackenzie novel on which the film was based, and how the film kinda sorta upends them, and a funny but not entirely far-fetched theory that <em>The Wicker Man</em> is a stealth remake of the movie. <em>The Maggie</em>, from 1954, is something of a spiritual sequel to Whisky. Another shipping-and-cargo shaggy dog tale, its endearing charms include Paul Douglas, here at a peak of soulfulness, in the role of a mildly philistine American businessman whose heart is warmed by some conniving Scots (sounds a little like another, more recent Scottish picture we know). Mastered from a BFI restoration, it actually looks better than W<em>hisky</em> — beautiful contrast and sharp detail abound. Mackendrick’s filmography is small, but it’s been elusive on Bluray let alone any other format. This bountiful package is a meaningful correction. <strong>— A+</strong></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3e2d5c200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Marching Song" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3e2d5c200c img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f58834025d9b3e2d5c200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Marching Song" /></a>&quot;Let&#39;s take a subject of great simplicity, some phase of life in this great country and make it screamingly funny to an amazed and happily unsettled world.&quot; Orson Welles wrote to his schoolmaster and mentor, Roger Hill, in the summer of 1932. &quot;Even as I write this an idea for a half-opera/half-revue pops on the horizon. A history of America in, let&#39;s say, ten scenes! Discovery, Revolution, Pioneering, Abolition, Civil War, Suffrage, Prohibition, Bootlegging, Advertising, The Newspaper Business — Whoa! There&#39;s an idea! The newspaper business as an operetta! A Front Page Gershwin only more so.&quot; He was about 17 at the time. Let it never be said that the kid lacked for ambition. One supposes he thought it would be fun...to write an operetta...about a newspaper.&#0160;</p>
<p>If the creative fervor and precocity here is not impressive enough, it should be noted that he wrote those words even as he was failing to sell an already-written theater piece that he and Hill had collaborated on, <em>Marching Song</em>, an abolition play about John Brown, one that fully acknowledges Brown&#39;s fanaticism but also is pretty blunt in its position that extremism in defense of liberty is at most a minor vice. Last year Rowman and Littlefield published <em>Marching Song</em> in a splendid, illuminating edition edited by Todd Tarbox, who&#39;s also responsible for the superb <a href="omecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2013/07/orson-welles-and-roger-hill-a-friendship-in-three-acts-by-todd-tarbox.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Orson Welles and Roger Hill: A Friendship In Three Acts.&#0160;</em></a></p>
<p>I can&#39;t recommend the book highly enough. The play itself is a fascinating piece of work, perhaps classifiable as juvenilia but marked by a passion and commitment that&#39;s remarkable in an artist of any age. Welles was a special kind of humanist, one who knew that idealism without works is dead. Hence his portrayal of Brown. Hence his 1946 radio addresses on Isaac Woodard, Jr., which are reproduced in the copious and sensitive supporting materials buttressing the play at both ends of the volume.&#0160;</p>
<p>What struck me most in the play, though, was the elaborate care with which Welles (with Hill) described the work&#39;s characters. I don&#39;t read many contemporary plays and it&#39;s been a while since I looked into drama from the first half of the 20th century, but I&#39;m not sure if I did that I&#39;d come across anything much like the description, say, of Martha Evelyn Brown, the wife of one of John Brown&#39;s sons, Oliver:&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The front door in the parlor opens and Martha comes in. She&#39;s a truly beautiful girl with gold-brown hair and serious baby-wide blue0grey eyes. She is childishly earnest, and erratic as a child in moods and emotions. There is something puckish and youthfully impish about her, but she lacks Annie&#39;s mature sense of humor and perspective. Born in the shadow of tragedy, despite her breezy manner, she is a little girl trying to be grown up, trying to look and act like a wife, a woman of responsibilities. Her big questioning eyes mirror the wonder and bewilderment that is in her soul. In her passionate and undisciplined heart, she loves her husband, Oliver, deeply, almost wildly, but she also loves Edwin Cook and many others. There is something of the real mother, the essential mother impulse, beating in that little child heart of hers. Now, she is loaded with parcels. She kicks the door shut.</em></p>
<p>Welles&#39; own earnestness, while not quite childlike, is kind of charming in the writing here. Whatever made him more hard-nosed (and it could well have been Herman Mankiewicz himself to an extent), a balance of cynicism and lyricism not evidenced in this early drama was clearly useful for <em>Kane</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another feature that impresses is Welles&#39; already spectacular grasp of stagecraft. The book includes a number of sketches he made for a potential production of the play, one of which I reproduce below:&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51849b3200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sketch by Welles" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a51849b3200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a51849b3200b-800wi" title="Sketch by Welles" /></a></p>
<p>Tarbox&#39;s biographical preface, the copious Epilogue, and Simon Callow&#39;s brief but definitely not-phoned-in introduction round the book out. Like <em>A Friendship In Three Acts</em>, it&#39;s absolutely essential Wellesiana.&#0160;</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t like <em>Shutter Island</em>. I get that. It’s excessive, lurid, and even those who’d argue the excess is part of the point will perhaps admit it does duty above and beyond in that respect. Mystery mavens will tell you the film’s plot is laughably obvious. It’s arguable that the film conjures up tropes of the atrocities of 20<sup>th</sup> century history far too glibly.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2010/02/shutter-island.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">praised</a> the movie when it was released in February of 2010, but these days when it comes up on social media I don’t offer too full-throated a defense of the movie, if any at all. And if the movie comes up in conversation with friendly acquaintances, and one of them proclaims “Well that sucked,” or something along those lines, I just zip my mouth tight and shrug.</p>
<p>Almost all my adult life I had been a hard drinker. When my family moved from Dumont to Lake Hopatcong in the mid-‘70s, when I was between my sophomore and junior years in high school, I was terribly irritated to be consigned to the sticks, but I wound up doing well there. I was a social pariah in Dumont, something to do with my brash personality, but at Jefferson Township High School I found friends, quite a few of them, and many of them are friends to this day. There were social hierarchies there but they didn’t seem to be taken quite as seriously in the more cosmopolitan realms of Bergen County. The jocks and the self-described “band f*gs” kind of got along, and they drank together at a bar called Rudy’s that sat at the top of one of the mountains separating Hopatcong from Milton. It was there that I did not learn how to drink. I remember trying to do a “flaming shot” of Green Chartreuse and spilling it, pretty little flames dancing on the linoleum. The proprietors were pretty tolerant of that sort of thing. Of course they were serving sixteen-year-olds without even making a show of carding them.</p>
<p>In any event. Once I began writing for a living almost a decade later, I had your standard issue perspective on the position of alcohol in the life of a scribe. One friend would refer to what he considered my “interesting relationship” to spirits, which he did not take as alcoholism.</p>
<p>Whether I had been an actual alcoholic during the better part of the relationship is, at least from this perspective, neither here nor there. But the relationship took a decisive turn when I lost my office job (at the website spun off from Premiere magazine, a job I should not have accepted in the first place, but that is, again, neither here nor there) and was obliged, for the first time since the mid-1990s, to work as a freelancer.</p>
<p>This was in 2008. My ticket to Cannes was already bought, and I started the blog you are reading now. I got a lot of sympathy and not a lot of work. For the third time, neither here nor there in the larger scheme of things. I drank like more of a fish than I ever had,&#0160; I got fatter than I’d ever been, I was invited to play a fat monster in a Steven Soderbergh movie.</p>
<p>Some time in 2009 it occurred to me that because I felt I had to have a lot of alcohol every single day, I might have a problem. This was pretty plain to my wife Claire as well. My routine was something like this: I’d get out of bed a little before noon. (My wife, on her way to her office job, would cheerily repeat a little mantra she’d formulated, reminding me to perform a few actions, including showering and putting on fresh clothing.) I’d do a little work. I’d wonder if I should go to Hanley’s for lunch. And whether, when there, I’d just have one drink. There was a pretty lively afternoon crew at Hanley’s, including a carpenter who had inexplicably cut off a part of his finger recently. The bartender was a goddess with the buy back. Some time after five, I’d ooze on back to my house, and try to arrange myself as if I had not spent the afternoon getting utterly hammered. It was kind of tedious for me, and really sad for my wife. I had long past burned my way through my Premiere severance and was in the process of obliterating our shared savings.</p>
<p>I tried some of them there &quot;meetings.&quot; (I like how Paul Williams describes his sober path in the book <em>Trust and Gratitude</em>: “The path I took to get here is the oldest and best hope for any alcoholic of addict who seeks help.” He does not refer to it by name and I’m going to follow his example.) They did not work for me. I literally walked out of one muttering to myself that I was entirely entitled to my resentments. Claire asked me to go speak to a counselor at the New York office of Hazelden. We had an amiable chat. I told him that I did not care much for the chair of one of these meetings; I suspected that he ran the numbers game in our neighborhood (he didn’t). “So you’re concerned that he doesn’t walk the walk,” the Hazelden counselor asked with what I did not recognize at the time as exquisite sarcasm. “Exactly,” I said.</p>
<p>That was in the summer. I drank through the fall and the winter. I white-knuckled a week at my in-laws’ place. There was a bottle of Maker’s Mark in a cabinet under their microwave and I contrived to drain just a little of it for myself one day while everyone was out shopping or something. (The bottle is still there, and it’s at the same level I left it.) When we came home after New Year’s, I had given up all pretense. Every day when I woke up I&#0160; immediately contrived to get my first drink. My most cherished time was Happy Hour at Blue Ruin, a still-extant dive (and I mean that in the nicest way) on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. Two-for-one from four to eight. That’s a lot of Wild Turkey 100 Proof with a Stella pint for relatively little money. I’d sit in the bad lighting with a bunch of poor creepy guys like myself and play Stooges songs on the jukebox. And drink.</p>
<p>In late January Claire left town, to tour the country in a production of <em>Gravity Radio</em>, a music/theater piece by Mikel Rouse, who also was the primary performer. Claire was the newscaster whose stories, which she chose from the real news every day, punctuated Mikel’s “radio” songs.</p>
<p>The cat being away, I played. I don’t want to get too specific, and anyway, as the Rutles once sang, “Do I have to spell it out?”</p>
<p>I don’t even remember just what I was doing for work at that specific moment in time, but one of my clients was the MSNBC website, which ran all sorts of original editorial at the time, and paid okay for said editorial. My editor there called me up the morning of January 27. Would I be interested, he asked, in doing the video junket for the new Scorsese movie, <em>Shutter Island</em>? I would be interviewing Leonardo Di Caprio and Ben Kingsley, but not the director. This despite the fact that Scorsese was someone I’d interviewed not infrequently back when Premiere magazine was still a magazine. A magazine where I ruled the roost to the extent that once, two fact checkers quit because my boss wouldn’t fire me for yelling at them all the time.</p>
<p>I was not keen — I try not to appear on camera if I can help it, honest — but then Dave, for that was my editor’s name, said the labor paid five hundred dollars. That was good, because at the time of our conversation I had more or less no money. I had no substances. I had little alcohol: &#0160;A can of Sapporo Premium Beer — one of those fluted 22 ounce jobs. So, you know, who cared who I interviewed, or didn’t interview?</p>
<p>After the phone call, I drained that fluted can and went about trying to make myself presentable. And coherent. The screening was on the early evening of the 28<sup>th</sup>, which was the next day, and the junket was on the morning of the 29<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>While I was an avid Scorsese person, I had not been following the making of the film; I had other things going on. So I went in relatively clean. And I was knocked this way and that for a while — a lot of the time it seemed that Scorsese was aiming for a high-toned variant of a Hammer film. Which was fine with me, provisionally.</p>
<p>Almost two hours into the movie, there’s a flashback involving the film’s central character, &quot;Teddy Daniels&quot;, played by DiCaprio. It’s from a time when he was an officer of the law, married, with two children. At this point, unbeknownst to him, his wife, who’s severely depressed, has drowned those two children and has laid them out on the back lawn. It’s been shown that throughout his marriage Teddy has ignored, or at least been ignorant of, his wife’s mental illness. In the scene prior, Teddy has hallucinated a conversation with his wife and one of his dead children. Now, in the flashback, he is returning to a beautiful house of stone. “I’m back,” he bellows, seeing no one in the house and&#0160; expecting that Dolores (Michelle Williams) will hear him outside. He takes off his jacket, folds it over his arm. “We got him just outside of Oklahoma.” He takes off his hat and puts that and the jacket on a chair. “We must have stopped ten places between here and Tulsa, I could sleep for a week.” He moves over to the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Now the audience already is aware of what has happened to the children, and of the state Dolores is in. If you’ve been able to achieve any kind of emotional connection to the movie by this point, it weighs heavily.</p>
<p>Teddy opens a cabinet, pulls a bottle of whiskey out of it, says “Dolores?” and pours a not-all-that stiff belt into a glass. He downs it and shows his teeth, temporarily satisfied. It wasn’t that big of a drink. But it was something that he put in front of everything else. He looks behind him and yells “Dolores” again.</p>
<p>This was my white light moment. My moment of clarity. I do not exaggerate when I profess that it hit me like a thunderbolt. In an instant. This is me. And this is what is going to happen: I am going to lose my marriage (by destroying it) and I am going to lose my mind (by destroying it) and I am going to die.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch and did a little math. If I did not drink between now and six-thirty the next evening, I could go to one of those meetings and proclaim that I was an alcoholic, and I could ask for help.</p>
<p>The next day I got to the junket site early. It was the Hotel Parker Meridian and the junketeers were offered a stupendous breakfast buffet and I sure did appreciate it. I was herded into a waiting area to do my first interview, with Di Caprio. A journalist of my acquaintance noticed me with some surprise. You don’t usually do these kinds of things, he noticed. “Have you got a one-on-one with Scorsese?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said glumly. “Essentially I’m Tyrone Power near the end of <em>Nightmare Alley</em>.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that movie,” he said.</p>
<p>That night, at the meeting, the guy I thought ran the numbers took one look at me, ashen in my overcoat, and said “Tis the season.” That was January 29, 2010. I haven’t had a drink since then. Thanks to everyone who helped.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;arial black&#39;, &#39;avant garde&#39;;">I have never found ranked lists of anything entirely credible, because after all what could be the really credible meteric by which a critic could take a group of films, or books, or restaurants even, that they admired during a discrete time period and break down their various levels of quality to the extent that the distinctions between one and ten were so argumentatively substantial that you could understand just why the tenth best was at that bottom rung (as opposed to why that first best so roundly exemplified the virtues of the art form under discussion). I doubt that most critics go to the trouble of really breaking down those distinctions, if any in fact exist. And it seems like the process, which I suspect might be more of a math problem than an aesthetic one, would be laborious, tedious, and sure, ultimately pointless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;arial black&#39;, &#39;avant garde&#39;;">Which is a long-winded way of getting to the point that I&#39;m not sure why, this year, I decided to present 25 of my most-loved films of 2019 in a ranked list, the assembly process of which mainly consisted of shuffling around the 17 titles below the top eight. Or the 20 titles below the top ten. Or something. Which is not to say, for instance, that I don&#39;t think <em>Little Women</em> is a better film than <em>Marriage Story</em>, for those of you apt to raise an eyebrow. I do. But not worlds better. Only a bit.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1) <a href="https://decider.com/2019/11/29/how-i-finally-stopped-worrying-about-the-irishman/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Irishman </em></a></span><span class="s1">(Martin Scorsese)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The piece I wrote about this movie for Decider is not a proper review but does contain some, you know, observations. It also has an explanation as to why the content of this blog has been even less than less than robust for a while. I also, for Decider, wrote about <a href="https://decider.com/2019/12/20/jimmy-hoffa-al-pacino-jack-nicholson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pacino&#39;s Hoffa</a> and Nicholson&#39;s Hoffa.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) <em>Pain and Glor</em>y (Pedro Almodóvar)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beautiful, vulnerable, surprising. And in terms of acting, practically a tie with The Irishman.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/movies/black-mother-review.html"><em>Black Mother</em> </a>(Khalik Allah)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) <em>Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood</em> (Quentin Tarantino)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My thought upon leaving the screening was, &quot;Goddamn him, he did exactly what I did not wish for him to do, and he made me love it.&quot;&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5) <em>High Life</em> (Claire Denis)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A refreshingly blunt science-fiction movie.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6) <em>Climax</em> (Gaspar Noé)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lurid sensationalism done right.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7) <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/venice-film-festival-2018-vox-lux-dragged-across-concrete-at-eternitys-gate" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dragged Across Concrete</em> </a>(S. Craig Zahler)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8) <em>Uncut Gems</em> (Josh and Bennie Safdie)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stressful. The only movie to elicit an actual nightmare for me in some time.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">9) <em>Rolling Thunder Revue</em> (Martin Scorsese)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A delightful jest, with notable music.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">10) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/asako-i-and-ii-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Asako 1 + 2</em></a> (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">11) <em>The Image Book</em> (Jean-Luc Godard)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let me Rolle it to you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12) <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>&#0160; (Céline Sciamma)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An impressive hybrid of Art Film and Movie-Movie With Strong Rooting Interest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">13) <em>Little Women</em> (Greta Gerwig)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Guys, it&#39;s good! It&#39;s got mise-en-scéne! But seriously: I kept hearing about how radical and stuff it was, but what more impressed me about the picture was its genuine tenderness. There&#39;s a rare delicacy of feeling here.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">14) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/movies/the-burial-of-kojo-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Burial of Kojo</em></a> (Blitz Bazawule)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">15) <em>Dark Water</em>s (Todd Haynes)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People have said things like, &quot;Todd Haynes should work outside his comfort zone more often&quot; but why is taking on a directing job at the request/behest of another artist you admire some kind of alienated labor? The direction and the restless inventiveness of Ed Lachman&#39;s cinematography are nothing but assured. And yes, I am going to be replacing much of the household cookware.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">16) <em>Marriage Story</em> (Noah Baumbach)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Doesn&#39;t take sides.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">17) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/movies/in-fabric-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>In Fabric</em></a> (Peter Strickland)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">18) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/movies/long-days-journey-into-night-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>A Long Day’s Journey into Night</em></a> (Bi Gan)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">19) <em>Parasite</em> (Bong Joon Ho)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A very good Bong Joon Ho picture.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">20) <em>The Dead Don’t Die</em> (Jim Jarmusch)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not just another Jarmusch movie, but that also. There&#39;s real and new discomfort under its droll get-off-my-lawn-surfaces.&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">21) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/suburban-birds-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Suburban Birds</em></a> (Qiu Sheng)</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I&#39;ve come around a bit on it since the above-linked Venice consideration. My more recent consideration is, if you think it&#39;s too much, good. Think about why you think that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;arial black&#39;, &#39;avant garde&#39;;">Films I Could Not Review</span></p>
<p>Of course, I was quite taken with both <em>High Flying Bird</em> and <em>The Laundromat</em> (whose Brechtian finale proved something of a critical point of contention), and I recommend those films highly. But I remain too much personally in the camp of Steven Soderbergh (sorry if that sounds like a humblebrag or whatever you call it) to recommend them without <span style="font-family: &#39;arial black&#39;, &#39;avant garde&#39;;">full disclosure</span>. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4fc087a200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="IMG_6611" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4fc087a200b img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4fc087a200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="IMG_6611" /></a> Here, for example, is a photo taken of myself yucking it up in Venice, at the film festival, with Corey Bayes, the first associate editor on both films, and someone who has helped me out with a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/best-editing-oscar-explained">wonky piece</a> or two. What an afternoon that was! Earlier in the day, I was hotly excoriated on Twitter by a &quot;positive&quot; film blogger who called me something like a &quot;shit scumbag&quot; for making sport of some eminently-make-sport-of-able thing he&#39;d said about <em>Joker</em>. Anyway, here he comes waltzing (I had another verb, beginning with a &quot;w&quot; and ending in a &quot;g,&quot; but it was not positive enough) into the very same reception (and not nearly so well dressed as Corey and I, not to mention the mysterious beauty behind us), and I&#39;m thinking — get this — &quot;Now&#39;s the time to mend fences. I should introduce him to the gang.&quot; I then mentioned the events of earlier in the day to Corey, who said, &quot;He must be a very important person if he can call you such things.&quot; Anyway. I never got around to making the introductions. Like the song says, &quot;Oh well. We&#39;ll catch up some other time.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;arial black&#39;, &#39;avant garde&#39;;">That&#39;s it. Surely the year also offered us terrible films, and bad-as-opposed to good films, but I&#39;ve got to get back to work on the book so better not to stir up stuff. See you around these parts in April I hope.&#0160;</span></p>

<p>People in the U.S. are really into hating jazz.</p>
<p>Remember when a bunch of us got really cranky about that Buzzfeed “What’s the deal with jazz?” thing? (Yeah, no, I’m not gonna link to it.) Then just a couple of weeks ago on the Twitter a high-profile profile writer recounted how Billy Bob Thornton once told her that jazz was a long con and that anyone who said they liked it was just doing a long con themselves.</p>
<p>That hurt my feelings and made me mad. The statement comes from a guy who, when I hung out with him, owned five discrete physical copies of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band’s <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>, a record highly informed by jazz, and not the easy kind.</p>
<p>If there’s ever a record that people get accused of just pretending to like so they look cool, it’s <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>. So you’d think Billy Bob, or as I’m going to call him from now on out of spite, William Robert, would know better. This shit takes work, whether you’re pulling the long con or not. I’ve been up to it for so long I can’t even tell the difference anymore.</p>
<p>I got into jazz for the same reason every other white male in America in the 1960s got into jazz: so I could <em>look like a beatnik</em>. I had a high school teacher who loaned me his copy of John Coltrane’s free jazz blowout <em>Ascension</em>, and it was exciting to discover that I could piss off my parents with a recording of unamplified instruments as easily, maybe even more easily, than I could with the first side of <em>Led Zeppelin II</em> or the title track of John Cale’s <em>Fear</em>. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4c9164d200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Beatnik" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4c9164d200b img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4c9164d200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Beatnik" /></a>About five years later at Dover’s Show Place, after a Richard Hell and the Voidoids show there, I met guitarist Robert Quine, who really looked like a beatnik, and who told me about Impulse accidentally pressing up the wrong take of the piece and putting out the right take with a different serial number, the kind of arcana that really enhances record collecting. (The eventual compact disc editions would throw on both takes because why not, <em>bonus track baby</em>!)</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to start a jazz collection, you could do a lot worse than picking up any one of the 42 compact discs roosting on my living room floor, near my coffee table. I work from home and I don’t need complete silence to function. While our apartment has a study, I like to work in the living room so I can listen to my <em>tunes</em> on a medium-snazzy hi-fi system. I listen a lot and I’m a physical media person so the space is in a constant cycle of tidying and untidying, which my partner sometimes finds frustrating. But we can hug it out.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>There’s no ranking, it’s just by whatever I picked up first. And, as always, purists beware, you may be alarmed or offended. Actually probably not, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>42) Tina Brooks, <em>Back to the Tracks</em> (Blue Note, recorded 1960)</p>
<p>Once you got through all the MAJOR guys in bop and post bop (most hipster jazz aficionados of the ‘70s didn’t know from swing/big band and didn’t want to, really) you then got into the major minors or the minors. This is not to make qualitative distinctions as such, just to recognize a pecking order with respect to, I don’t know, either innovation or prominence. John Zorn formed the trio News For Lulu with trombonist George Lewis and guitarist Bill Frisell (hey, I just spoke with him today after hearing him play live!) to celebrate compositions by lesser-known Blue Note stalwarts like Sonny Clark (of whom it has been said, very unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/best-jazz-albums" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Clark’s death, at 31, was down to both alcohol abuse and heroin dependency. How very jazz.”</a>), Freddie Redd, Hank Mobley, and more. Tina Brooks, a tenor sax guy (yes, <em>guy</em>; Fats Navarro was nicknamed “Fat Girl” despite being neither fat nor a girl; jazz people, what can you do with them?) was not quite a major minor but he had a good feel for blues forms and a coherent sound and here he’s backed by a murderer’s row of sidemen (that’s a viable cliché, right?) including horn men Blue Mitchell and Jackie McLean and Kenny Drew, Paul fucking Chambers and Art Taylor as the rhythm section. Solid!</p>
<p>41) Lee Konitz, Brad Meldau, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian, <em>Live At Birdland</em> (ECM 2011)</p>
<p>Lee’s too cool for some, or for school, or for something, But he lays out acerbic but dreamy alto very generously here. It’s like he’s taking his idol Lester Young out to lunch with Wittgenstein. (That sounds pretty good, right?) Charlie and Paul are dreamy as usual.</p>
<p>40) Cedar Walton, Bob Berg, Sam Jones, Billy Higgins, <em>Eastern Rebellion 2</em> (Ti, 1977)</p>
<p>Walton’s a fabulous post-bop pianist and a flat-out great writer and this is one of the nicest quartet dates of his I’ve managed to rustle up, not that I’ve been able to rustle up too many. What do you want from me. Billy Higgins is unimpeachable as always.</p>
<p>39) <em>Sonny Stitt Sits In With The Oscar Peterson Trio</em> (Verve, 1959)</p>
<p>Pretty much as advertised.</p>
<p>38) <em>Sounds of Liberation</em> (Corbett Versus Dempsey, 2019)</p>
<p>An exuberant politically-resonant burner led by Byard Lancaster, here on alto. Funky as hell. But also cheerful and relaxed at times. Recorded at Columbia University in 1973 and never released until now, which as a result meant the revolution didn’t happen. Damn it.</p>
<p>37) Harold Land, <em>The Fox</em>, (Contemporary, 1958)</p>
<p>I saw Land, with Billy Higgins drumming and grinning, and some other great sidemen, at the Jazz Standard in the early 2000s, maybe, and he blew me away. I’ve never found a record of his that does the same, as admirable as I’ve found many. You know when Chuck Berry said “I got no kick against modern jazz/&#39;cept when they try and play it too darn fast?” Sometimes I’ll hear Harold Land and it reminds me of that. This one has the great and under-sung Monk-extrapolation pianist Elmo Hope on it so I need to check it again.</p>
<p>36) Paul Motian box set (ECM, 2013)</p>
<p>Six discs of Armenian Psychedelic Jazz, exploratory but superbly disciplined trio workouts, advents of Joe Lovano and Bill Frisell, all anchored by a revolutionary percussionist who defined humanist drumming. Great booklet essay by Ethan Iverson, the wonderful pianist with whom I’ve become friendly in the past year (I hope he doesn’t mind me saying so, and particularly in the context of what’s at least one-quarter a pisstake) and <a href="https://ethaniverson.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">whose writings</a> consistently help me understand The Music better.</p>
<p>35) <em>Wes Montgomery Trio</em> (Riverside, 1959)</p>
<p>Took me a while to get this guy. Is he TOO tasteful? I’m not sure. He’s not any kind of iconoclast but the depth and complexity of his harmonic conception isn’t complacent either. Especially on early sides such as these.</p>
<p>34) Dave Douglas, Uri Caine, Andrew Cyrille, <em>Devotion</em> (Greenleaf, 2019)</p>
<p>Douglas is a searching musician whose treks don’t always hook me. This session, clearly an unusually significant one for him, pairs him with pianist Caine, a longtime collaborator, and drummer Cyrille, who I’d listen to play a phone book. I’ve had this record for a while, but as I heard one 20-something longhair say to another while on line to see Lou Reed at the Capitol Theater in Passaic in 1974, re Reed’s then-new <em>Sally Can’t Dance</em>, “I haven’t gotten into it yet.”</p>
<p>33) William Parker/In Order to Survive, <em>Live at Shapeshifter</em> (Aum, 2019)</p>
<p>I sometimes have a hard time navigating Parker working with expanded song-forms or experimenting with jazz oratorio and such. But I have no problem hearing him blow with Rob Brown on alto, the indefatigable Cooper-Moore on piano, and Elvin Jones inheritor Hamid Drake on drums.</p>
<p>32) Dunmall, Gibbs, Taylor, Young <em>Landscapes</em> (FMR, 2019)</p>
<p>Paul Dunmall’s a British saxist/flautist of indefatigable energy who puts out a record about once every twenty minutes. I’ve not heard a bad one yet, although some leave me cold. This, with a bassist, violist and guitarist backing him, is pretty intriguing.</p>
<p>31) Matt Mitchell, <em>Phalanx </em>Ambassadors (Pi, 2019)</p>
<p>A fab NYC scene pianist with a quintet in which the female players outnumber the male, which is nice. Cerebral in the sense the title implies, but not dry.</p>
<p>30) Keith Jarrett, <em>Arbour Zena</em>, (ECM, 1976)</p>
<p>Wait, is this even jazz? Here Jarrett trios up with Haden and Motian with a string orchestra behind. Because so much of the final third of his career has been devoted to improvising with the now-defunct Standards Trio, Jarrett’s writing isn’t talked about much except by mavens. It’s good. This is a good record. It might not be jazz.</p>
<p>29) Houston Person with Ron Carter, <em>Just Between Friends</em> (High Note, 2005)</p>
<p>This most certainly is jazz. Person, born in 1934, formed his style before Coltrane shook things up and to this day plays with a pleasing burr, a nice sense of fizzy intoxication. Ron Carter is Ron Carter. The set begins with “How Deep Is The Ocean” and contains “Polka Dots and Moonbeams.” Get it?</p>
<p>28) Forde Gjerstad &#0160;with William Parker and Hamid Drake, <em>On Reade Street</em> (FMR, 2006)</p>
<p>Norwegian alto/clarinet yawper of distinction meets two American contemporary giants. I don’t think I’ve actually listened to this yet.</p>
<p>27) Steve Kuhn Trio w/ Joey Baron and Steve Swallow, <em>To and From The Heart</em>, (Sunnyside 2018)</p>
<p>Pianist Kuhn in a mood almost (but not quite) soporifically sweet and tonic. Exceptionally listenable.</p>
<p>26) Duke Ellington Octet, <em>At The Rainbow Grill 1967</em> (Gambit, ?)</p>
<p>This is a bootleg that took me forever to acquire. Sounds like a bootleg too. See below.</p>
<p>25) Bill Evans, <em>California Here I Come</em>&#0160; (Verve, 1967)</p>
<p>I acquired this and the above Ellington live set — recorded on the same night! — to complete the interactive part of Ethan Iverson’s New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/duke-ellington-bill-evans-and-one-night-in-new-york-city" rel="noopener" target="_blank">article</a> in which he contrasts Evan’s modal improvisations with Ellington’s &#0160;(and Paul Gonsalves’) soloing and vamping&#0160; on the chord changes. The paradox is that while Ellington and company were playing for a dance crowd and Evans was playing for the serious listeners of the Village Vanguard, Ellington’s getting into knottier harmonic territory. The differences are fascinating and both performances are terrific. Evans is easier-listening while Ellington steadfastly answers the demands of his market at the time while stealthily delivering a sophistication he just can’t help. I imagine that in 1967 jazz was even further alienated from the contemporary popular culture than it is today. Of the two artists it was probably Evans who was considered “hipper” at the time.</p>
<p>24) Art Pepper, <em>Live at Fat Tuesday’s</em> (Elemental, 2005 recorded 1988)</p>
<p>After his searing autobiography <em>Straight Life</em> was published in 1979, altoist Pepper would spend the next, what, three whole years of his life (he died in 1982, aged 56) working his ass off in studios and on the road; they’re still putting out previously unreleased material from this era. Garrulous on stage, the not-quite-clean Pepper (he claimed to have given up getting high as such but apparently there was a whole lot of self-medicating going on) was an equally generous soloist, and on this set with Al Foster on drums he goes to town on two standards, one Monk, and two of his own compositions, which tend to the melancholy even when ostensibly upbeat. He had great tone, great feel and a LOT to say. Check him out.</p>
<p>23) Keith Jarrett, <em>Paris/London, Testament</em> (ECM, 2009)</p>
<p>Jarrett described his own mental state prior to the 2008 London concerts transcribed here in a beautiful <a href="https://ethaniverson.com/interviews/interview-with-keith-jarrett/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> with Ethan Iverson in 2009. A lot of the time when musicians talk out their own work it’s difficult to frame up what they’re saying with what you hear. In this case, it’s all there. And yes, the music is uncommonly emotionally direct. It’s easy to rag on Jarrett because of his oft-detailed personal prickliness, and a lot of the time on his solo recordings I get thrown by his seeming inability to distinguish between his best ideas and his worst, but when it comes down to it he really is a genius of modern music and his recording with Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette are constant founts of pleasure and soul.</p>
<p>22) <em>Barry Guy @ 70</em> (FSR 2018)</p>
<p>British free player of exquisite sensitivity. This is a three disc set, live recording of a birthday event as you may have inferred. So far I’ve only listened to the trio session with Marilyn Crispell on piano and Paul Lytton on bass but it’s a delight.</p>
<p>21) Dexter Gordon, 5 Original Albums</p>
<p>Less than 20 bucks at Academy and featuring <em>Doin’ Allright</em>, <em>Dexter Calling</em>, <em>A Swingin’ Affair</em>, <em>One Flight Up</em>, and <em>Getting’ Around</em>. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG IF YOU ENCOUNTER THIS SET UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>20) Dexter Gordon Quartet, <em>Tokyo 1975</em> (Elemental 2018)</p>
<p>On a lot of ‘70s jazz, the recording makes my teeth hurt a little at first. Pianos sound too bright, very nightclubby if you know what I mean. I have this problem with Gordon’s small-band major-label 1978 <em>Manhattan Symphonie</em>, too. It’s not as pronounced on this exuberant set featuring Kenny Drew on piano and Albert Heath on drums. But it’s there, and my ears need to adjust to it. I’ve always had this problem with “Old Folks,” maybe stemming from the fact that for years of my active alcoholism my radio alarm was tuned to Phil Schapp’s Charlie Parker morning show on whatever that FM station was and he’d invariably play the Parker-with-chorus “Old Folks” three or four times a week and it seriously, I mean, have you ever HEARD it? And then have you ever heard it while HUNG OVER? Anyway, they do “Old Folks” on here and it’s tolerable.</p>
<p>19) <em>The Tal Farlow Monkey Album</em> (Norgran, 1955)</p>
<p>Farlow’s long fingers and searching musical intelligence enabled him to leap incredible intervals in a single bound. But the guitarist was no shredder. He’s fleet, clean, and SUPER FRESH. When he goes on one of his long runs and bends the notes, it’s perfect exhilaration.</p>
<p>18) Art Blakey, <em>The Jazz Messengers</em> (Columbia 1956)</p>
<p>This assemblage features Donald Byrd, Hank Mobley, Horace Silver and Doug Watkins. All of them “cats.”</p>
<p>17) <em>The Max Roach Trio, Featuring The Legendary Hassan </em>(Atlantic 1965)</p>
<p>Hassan Ali was this hot pianist out of Philly who was big on Elmo Hope, who was big on Thelonious Monk. (One of the tunes here is called “Hope So Elmo.”) Hassan and Hope were well-versed in the strangely pleasing dissonances Monk advanced, and Hassan tricked these up with ever wackier and ever-changing time signatures. Challenging time signatures were among drummer Max Roach’s many breads and butters so it is apt that Hassan’s only official recording was made possible and led by Roach. Art Davis is the bassist.</p>
<p>16) Walter Bishop Jr. Trio, <em>Speak Low </em>(Venus 1993)</p>
<p>The plain truth is I got this because I momentarily mixed up Walter Bishop, Jr., with Walter Davis, Jr., whose<em> Scorpio Rising</em> is one of my favorite latter-day post-bop piano trio thangs and Davis didn’t record solo too often. Anyway. This is pretty good too. More lush than tricky (Davis is equally both) but very pleasing.</p>
<p>15) <em>Randy Weston Trio Plus Cecil Payne</em> (Fresh Sound compilation 2012)</p>
<p>Weston is a definite and absolute great but in terms of my attention has always stayed in the “subjects for further research” category. Here you get solid unfussy bop of uniform excellence, but nothing that will immediately blow your mind.</p>
<p>14) The John Coltrane Quartet, <em>The Complete Africa/Brass Sessions</em> (Impulse, 1961/1995)</p>
<p>Pretty much as advertised.</p>
<p>13) Art Blakey,<em> Indestructible</em> (Blue Note, 1964)</p>
<p>He does look badass on that cover, with the cigarette dangling from his mouth. He was also into heroin, too, apparently. That stuff’ll kill you. But lung cancer got him first, at 71, not young exactly but too young to die, especially these days. Where was I? Oh yeah. Despite being into heroin I’ve never heard a recorded instance of Blakey being inattentive. And on this record the messengers are Lee Morgan, less than a decade away from getting his ass shot by his common law wife in front of a bar where he was gigging, “how very jazz,” Wayne Shorter, who’s still with us, Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, and Reggie Workman. You know what to do.</p>
<p>12) Count Basie, <em>April in Paris</em> (Verve, 1958)</p>
<p>“An early influence and still something to always answer to the question, ”Who do I like as a piano player:” Count Basie. That’s the final arbiter of how to play two notes, the distance between them and the volume of them is perfect. I can’t hold myself to that standard, but I can appreciate it.” — Carla Bley, in an <a href="https://ethaniverson.com/interview-with-carla-bley/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> with, yes, Ethan Iverson</p>
<p>11) <em>The Amazing Bud Powell, Volume One</em> (Blue Note, 1951)</p>
<p>One of the things that frustrates a growing jazzbo is when you’re reading somehing about some artist or other that tells you that what you’re listening to right now isn’t that artist’s REAL STUFF. I remember years ago getting a reissue of Bill Evans’ Trio ’65 and the whole gist of the liner notes was that Chuck Israels was no Scott La Faro. HEY LINER NOTE WRITER DUDE, CHUCK ISRAELS IS STILL ALIVE EVEN AS I WRITE THIS. DO YOU THINK HE DOESN’T KNOW HE WAS NO SCOTT LA FARO? DO YOU THINK HE DOESN’T HAVE FEELINGS? Anyway, you get a lot of “you’ll never hear the good shit” when reading about Bud Powell. All the records were made after he started falling apart, etc. Nevertheless, this lives up to its title in my book.</p>
<p>10) Cannonball Adderley with Bill Evans, <em>You Know What I Mean?</em> (Riverside, 1961)</p>
<p>“Everybody Digs Bill Evans” was the statement used for an album title of the pianist’s, but the proclamation was arguably as true or more so for Cannonball, a delightful bluesy player and by most accounts a solid guy. Not a challenging classic, just a classic.</p>
<p>9) Paul Bley, <em>Footloose</em> (Savoy, 1960)</p>
<p>If you have a hard time getting into Ornette Coleman, one good way to try is by listening to his stuff interpreted by other players. This album, with Bley backed by Steve Swallow and the magnificent Pete LaRoca on drums, kicks off with a speedy version of Ornette’s “When Will The Blues Leave?” which may or may not help with conversion. The rest of the record is split between Paul and Carla’s tunes. This is definitely an underappreciated landmark of 20<sup>th</sup> century piano jazz.</p>
<p>8) Art Taylor, <em>AT’s Delight</em> (Blue Note, 1960)</p>
<p>Taylor, a drummer who was Present At The Creation of many landmark American Jazz Moments, also wrote, in 1977, an incredible book called <em>Notes and Tones</em>. It is made up of interviews in which Taylor invariably asks what is the situation of the black jazz musician today, and the interviewee invariably responds that the situation of the black jazz musician today is FUCKED UP. You really can’t say it enough. Anyway. This is one of his few records as leader and it’s a super friendly bop and post-bop session (kickoff track: Coltrane’s “Syeeda’s Song Flute,” one of his happiest tunes) featuring Wynton Kelly and Paul Chambers.</p>
<p>7) The Lucky Thompson Quartet, <em>Lucky Strike</em> (Prestige 1964)</p>
<p>Man, this cat is smooth. His tone on either soprano or tenor can melt you into a puddle. Hank Jones, Richard Davis and Connie Kay back him up, so climb on board all you <em>Astral Weeks</em> fans.</p>
<p>6) Sonny Rollins, <em>The Bridge</em> (RCA, 1962)</p>
<p>Every list of the greatest jazz albums ever needs at least one Sonny Rollins record on it. Good thing this was on my floor then. Although I prefer <em>East Broadway Run Down</em>.</p>
<p>5) Oscar Peterson, <em>My Favorite Instrument</em> (Verve, 1968)</p>
<p>It’s the piano! Who’d have guessed?</p>
<p>4) Duke Ellington and Ray Brown, <em>This One’s For Blanton</em> (Pablo, 1975)</p>
<p>Not quite the <em>ultimate</em> in jazzbo esoterica but <em>not nothing</em> in that department either. The background: In 1939 and 1940, Duke Ellington and Jimmy Blanton recorded some piano/double bass duets that were the first commercially released items of such jazz interplay ever. And as such genuinely groundbreaking. Blanton was a bassist of exceptional sensitivity, already an innovator while barely out of his teens. He died in 1942, at only 23 years of age, of tuberculosis. (How very not jazz, right?) In 1973, in Las Vegas yet, Duke and veteran bassist Ray Brown (stalwart of Oscar Peterson, stalwart and ex-husband of Ella Fitzgerald) laid down this tribute. It is lovely.</p>
<p>3) Bill Evans, <em>Some Other Time</em> (Resonance, 2017/1968)</p>
<p>This is one of two newly discovered and spiffily mastered Resonance releases chronicling an Evans trio with longtime collab Eddie Gomez on bass and not-for-long member Jack De Johnette on drums. In his first trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian, Evans kept Motian in line with his conception by encouraging him to use brushes. Motian became a low-key co-conspirator with La Faro’s revolutionary conception of time, while his more anarchic instincts were kept in check. I don’t know much about Marty Morell (although—holy shit!—I just found out that Evans covers my favorite Bobbie Gentry song, “Morning Glory,” on a Tokyo live album with Gomez and Morell) and I haven’t heard his one record with the genial Shelly Manne. With Philly Joe Jones, Evans swung. Jack DeJohnette, a definite hitter who would later become a huge Levon Helm fan, was a different proposition from any of these drummers, and he imbues these session with a drive that stands out without ever becoming overstated. And you can sense how this stretches Evans even as he sticks largely to a repertoire of reliable standards.</p>
<p>2) McCoy Tyner, <em>Today and Tomorrow </em>(Impulse, 1963)</p>
<p>Alternating between trio cuts with Jimmy Garrison and Albert Heath and a quintet with three horns, including that of Thad Jones, out front, this is an ideal way to get to know Tyner in the absence of Coltrane. McCoy still walks among us, by the way.</p>
<p>1) Bill Evans, <em>Another Time</em> (Resonance 2016/1968)</p>
<p>See number three. More of the same only live instead of studio. BUT an almost completely different playlist, including “Alfie.”</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4af0cf8200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Arrange2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5523026f588340240a4af0cf8200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://somecamerunning.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5523026f588340240a4af0cf8200b-800wi" title="Arrange2" /></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kirk and Kirk</span></p>
<p>On May 25th I had the honor of presenting, at the great NY moviehouse The Metrograph, Elia Kazan&#39;s 1969 <em>The Arrangement</em>. These are the program notes for the show:&#0160;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">“Plastic people! Oh baby now you’re such a drag!” So bellowed The Mothers of Invention in 1967. That same year Elia Kazan issued a not dissimilar cri de coeur in his doorstop-size novel “The Arrangement,” which he adapted into a film two years later. In Kazan’s complaint, &#0160;Kirk Douglas’ compulsively adulterous ad exec mounts his own rebellion against a values system that has made him affluent but empty. Is this a frantic, truculent indulgence? A <em>film maudit</em> of monumental proportions? Kazan’s own <em>Skidoo</em>? You have see this rarely-screened curio to find out.</span></p>
<p class="p3">A few of you out there have been kind enough to inquire if I could make my pre-screening remarks available in prose form. I worked from what I regard as loose notes, but I cleaned them up into something resembling what I said and/or an actual text. See below.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">In my program notes I quoted Frank Zappa’s “Plastic People.” Here’s another Zappa quote: “You’re probably wondering why I’m here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Why <em>The Arrangement</em>? Why now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">This screening came about as a result of some casual conversations I had with Jake Perlin, one of the programmers here. I had a book idea I’d been toying with, about the Great Hollywood Directors— Hitchcock, Preminger, Wyler, Kazan, and more — and the ways that they, and their work, reacted beginning in the early ‘60s when (and Preminger’s efforts had a lot to do with this in the first place) the Production Code imploded and these filmmakers had the freedom to do things that they’d never been allowed to do. In Hitchcock’s case, for instance, you have the morbidly explicit rape scene of <em>Frenzy</em>. With Preminger you have the explorations of <em>Skidoo</em> and the Burgess Meredith nude scene in <em>Such Good Friends</em>. With Kazan, you have <em>The Arrangement</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Now this movie didn’t start with a compulsion to break boundaries in filmmaking. Kazan, in the mid ‘60s, had what he considered a profound sense of dissatisfaction in his life which he channeled into a novel, which happened to coincide with a shifting zeitgeist. His marriage to Molly Kazan had ended with her death in 1963; he subsequently married Barbara Loden in 1967. He had a lot of tortured feelings concerning both relationships, which he details in his fascinating autobiography. In <em>The Arrangement</em> he wrestles with not just those feelings but a larger disgust with the phoniness of American life. Status symbols, affluence, their stifling influence on interpersonal relationships, particularly those of love. Which were coming into collision with the counterculture, which believed love should be free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Now you’re wondering if Jake and I were discussing these issues. No.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">This program was supposed to have been a double feature. The second feature was to have been 1960’s <em>Strangers When We Meet</em>, directed by Richard Quine and starring Kirk Douglas, Kim Novak, Barbara Rush, Ernie Kovacs and Walter Matthau. Written by Evan Hunter, whose estate, we have discovered, now retains the rights to the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Quine is what a friend of mine has called a &#0160;“major minor” Hollywood director and <em>Strangers</em> is one of his best, a work of great sensitivity and prescience. While <em>The Arrangement</em> knocks over its metaphors like a drunk entering a darkened living room and stumbling over the furniture, <em>Strangers</em> brings a real deftness to the whole work/love/integrity theme. And its treatment of insidious sexism —Kim Novak’s character is all but persecuted for looking like, well, Kim Novak — is also very sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">So that was supposed to be the idea&#0160;— the sexual revolution, 1960 and 1969, with Kirk Douglas the iconic bracketing. But we could not find a 35 print of <em>Strangers</em>, so here we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">One of the rather nastier features of <em>The Arrangement</em> is its treatment of Deborah Kerr. If you thought her having to almost yodel “Doodle me James” in the 1966 &#0160;<em>Casino Royale</em> was undignified, get a load of what she goes through here. &#0160;Kazan’s novel put across a certain amount of complexity on top of its baseline sexism, but in the film this too often translates into an attitude of &#0160;“Why must I, a new man with new ideas, be saddled with an OLD WIFE?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">The movie’s pre-echoes of <em>Network</em> are not limited to a particular manifestation of misogyny, but with Faye Dunaway as the object of desire that quality is hard to ignore. Neither film bothers to recognize that it’s the male-constructed power structures that help make the bitches that so bewitch the hapless middle-aged male. At least <em>Strangers</em> tries to bust its characters out of circumscribed gender roles, recognizes the oppression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Michael Higgins, later &#0160;of <em>Wanda</em>, plays the Douglas character’s brother Michael; look for an uncredited Barry Sullivan…Richard Boone, six months younger than Douglas, plays Douglas’ dad, and look, there’s practically teenage Michael Murphy as a priest!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Just when you think it’s peaked, the movie &#0160;gets weirder. When Dunaway is setting a table for Douglas and Boone you may ask yourself, well, how did I get here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Joni Mitchell was commissioned to write a song for the movie, and she did. It wasn’t used in the film, but the song “The Arrangement” appears on <em>Court and Spark</em> and bemoans the “credit card and the swimming pool in the backyard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;"><strong>REACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">From the NYPL Perf Arts clippings file…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Judith Crist: “126 minutes of sturm, drang and banality and about as turgid a job of soap-suds cinema to be found outside of <em>Peyton Place</em> reruns”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">“The sight of a 44-year-old wallowing in self-searchings that would embarrass today’s 14-year-old by its simple-mindedness is simply boring”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">“As a neophyte novelist, Kazan was entitled to a trash wallow, but his spreading The Arrangement over the big screen is inexcusable”&#0160; — New York mag Nov 24, 1969</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">John Simon: “ a senseless and banal story that reels from platitude to platitude”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">My old friend Joseph Failla wrote to me: &#0160;“You sure don&#39;t pick the easy ones to present, I&#39;ve seen THE ARRANGEMENT and thought it was great. I know late Kazan becomes difficult but I&#39;ve never understood Maltin&#39;s bomb rating either.Compelling from the opening moments till it&#39;s dreamy, hallucinatory conclusion. My favorite touch, Kirk&#39;s Batman style punch up in a bar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Not in a bar, as it happens, but imagined by Kurt as he looks into Dunaway’s NYC apartment window and sees a man (future Lars von Trier day player John Randolph Jones) in there. &#0160;</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I teach two recitation sections for a “Language of Film” class at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, and this week the main lecturer was screening Charles Burnett’s landmark 1977 debut feature Killer of Sheep, which he was using as an example of personal storytelling. For my 75-minute recitation section I thought I’d extrapolate on another aspect of Burnett’s work by screening sections of his third feature, <em>To Sleep With Anger</em> (just now available in a great Blu-ray from the Criterion Collection), the opening of Julie Dash’s 1991 <em>Daughters of the Dusk</em>, and the phantasmagoric “praise the griot” motorcade/parade scene from Djibril Diop Mambéty’s 1973 <em>Touki Bouki</em>. My class is not about cultural studies or cultural difference per se, but I chose these clips to demonstrate, minimally, a thesis I have concerning modes of cinematic storytelling in what I’ll call “black film.”</p>
<p>This would be taking place less than a week after <em>Green Book</em> had won the Best Picture Oscar, an event I did not actually see take place because my wife and I don’t watch the Oscars. We got into this habit in 2013, when we were vacationing in Iceland as that year’s ceremonies were happening, and we opted not to stay up to watch. We were so spiritually refreshed at not having seen the thing we decided that, barring a genuine rooting interest or something like it, we’d make this a new tradition. Anyway.</p>
<p>Several of my students had previously put forward some opinions and/or speculations about <em>Green Book</em>. It is a film not much liked by the students who’ve seen it, and viewed with suspicion by many who have not. The students in my class are largely white; more than a few are Asian-American, a couple are Asian, and about a half a dozen are African American.</p>
<p>I was walking to class and I was thinking about what to say about the movie if the subject came up. It occurred to me that one of the most objectionable things about it is that it extols the virtues of peace love and understanding from within an exclusively white cultural space. That is, it says “we can and should live together, on my cultural terms.” After winning the Oscar, one of the film’s producers, Jim Burke, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/green-book-oscar-victory-divide-hollywood-spike-lee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vented some frustration</a> to Sharon Waxman of <em>The Wrap</em>: “I can’t change the fact that I was born white.” This remarkable statement raises several fascinating questions, including “Would you, if you could?” But it also lays bare the mode of the film’s construction: if it’s building a bridge, it’s building it on Burke’s terms. “Can white people have or not have a point of view on racial inequality?” Burke then sputtered.</p>
<p>And there you have it. Just as in Joseph Mankiewicz’s remarkable, underrated 1950 film <em>No Way Out</em>, it all boils down to what the born-white person is EXTENDING to the black person. (The picture remains one of the most bullshit-free pictures about race relations made by a white American director.) At the end of <em>Green Book</em> the Don Shirley character enjoys the bounty of a white working class Italian American Christmas <em>by invitation</em>.</p>
<p>Over and over I’ve seen white folks who otherwise hold all sorts of <em>interesting</em> opinions about black folks call <em>Green Book</em> a “feel good” movie. Yes. Sure. You feel good. About yourself. Without having done anything. Without having gained, or try to gain, any knowledge of black culture. Instead, you’ve had an easy laugh at a mouthy mook telling a stuck-up black guy that the black guy doesn’t know enough about HIS OWN culture. Well don’t that just beat all.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some arguments that strongly implied that had the film been more accurate in its depiction of Don Shirley, it could not have made its important brotherhood points as strongly. In which case it’s only fair to ask, “Well, which points are you talking about?” &#0160;Because the film depicts Shirley in such a way as to <em>allow </em>the character Tony Lip to lecture the character Don Shirley about not knowing the cultural product of his own people. Whereas the actual, historical Don Shirley, in 1962, made an important recording called <em>Piano Arrangements Of Spirituals </em>and would subsequently record, in 1969, <em>The Gospel According To Don Shirley</em>.</p>
<p>All this came up in my discussions during the two sessions, and something came to my mind as these conversations were going on. Most of my students were maybe in second grade in 2007, when Bill O’Reilly made his visit to Sylvia’s in Harlem, and on his radio show marveled &#0160;“There wasn&#39;t one person in Sylvia&#39;s who was screaming, &#39;M-Fer, I want more iced tea.&#39; […] [I]t was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all-white suburb in the sense of people were sitting there, and they were ordering and having fun. And there wasn&#39;t any kind of craziness at all.&quot; It occurred to me that <em>Green Book</em> is in a sense a milder iteration of O’Reilly’s racialist damage. This analogy, once I explained to the kids who Bill O’Reilly actually was —time really does fly — did not seem particularly outrageous to them.</p>
<p>But still. It’s worth noting that Octavia Spencer is also a producer of the movie. And that the movie has elicited warm, genuine, intelligent praise from some African-Americans. I told one of the classes that Harry Belafonte’s praise for the film threw me for a loop. Particularly because Belafonte is a crucial presence in a sequence in <em>BlacKkKlansman </em>which contrasts an African American cultural space (a consciousness-raising meeting in which Belafonte’s character gives a traumatic accounting of a lynching) and a white cultural space (a Ku Klux Klan initiation).&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>At this, one of my students raised her hand and said “Harry Belafonte has been wrong before.”</p>

<p>Sometimes when my buddy Bruce Lee Gallanter, proprietor of my favorite extant NYC record store, <a href="http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Downtown Music Gallery</a>, is compiling an annual best-of feature for his newsletter, he asks me to kick in a top ten. And because I’m undisciplined this way, I give him a top thirty or thirty one. After drafting the list, I thought I’d do some re-listening, to make sure, and also draft some notes, a bunch detailed, others not, and having done THAT, put them up on the ole blog, which craves content. If any of these items interest you, you can likely order them from <a href="http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce’s place.</a></p>
<p><strong>AMM, <em>An</em> <em>Unintended Legacy </em>(Matchless)</strong> Reconvening with guitarist Keith Rowe for the first time in over ten years after a break occasioned by disagreements over practice, some aired by percussionist Eddie Prevost in a book of essays, this three-disc set presents three performances…it would not do to say “sounds like they picked up right where they left off,” because obsessive followers of the conglomerate know it’s not even close to being that simple. Nevertheless, the set does not contradict the now-decades-old observation that AMM recordings are as alike and unalike as trees. The title is not ironic, and the recording commemorates something final to be sure, as Keith Rowe, living with Parkinson’s disease, can no longer play guitar. (His October 2018 presentation at the New School made his condition its subject, and was performed on rudimentary electronic equipment, and was one of the most moving pieces of art I’ve ever experienced.)</p>
<p><strong>Simon Barker/Henry Kaiser/Bill Laswell/Rudresh Mahanthappa,&#0160; <em>Mudang Rock </em>(Fractal Music)&#0160;</strong>Korean-inspired jams as heavy as the players would lead you to believe they would be.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Blegvad Quintet, <em>Go Figure</em> (ReR)</strong> My old friend Mr. B is, finally, not an art rocker, but a singer songwriter, and finally, a sui generis one, with a splendid band including some art rockers behind him…Chris Cutler, Bob Drake, John Greaves, Karen Mantler. This record, his first collection in almost twenty years, highlights Peter’s humor, which, as befits several contemporary conditions, is frequently mordant. It is also wonderfully melodic, and played and sung with a warmth that’s a balm.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Brötzmann/Heather Leigh, <em>Sparrow Nights</em> (Trust)</strong> First studio recording of this galvanic duo, he a veteran of the very emphatic reed playing, she a relative newbie on the very emphatic pedal steel guitar. Live, as they’ve only been chronicled on disc before, they can and will tear the roof of the sucker (boy did they ever at Issue Project Room in June of 2017). Here, they opt for less volume some of the time, and a ragged, inventive lyricism a surprising part of the time. There’s a lot they can do.</p>
<p><strong>John Butcher/Eddie Prevost <em>Visionary Fantasies</em> (Matchless)</strong> One of three discs Matchless released in 2018 featuring Prevost with other improviser. The other two<em>, The Whole Moon Rests in a Dewdrop on the Grass,</em> with Ken Ikeda on electronics, and <em>Darkened, Yet Shone</em>, with John Edwards on bass and N.O. Moore on electric guitar, are equally extraordinary. I highlight this one just because, and also because I now consider Butcher the preeminent living fee improvisational reeds player. The music here, starting with solo statements from each player before a series of duets has the quality ancient architecture in motion, a series of stone corridors in which one hears the echoes of musical notes, vestigial groans, ghosts perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramic Dog, <em>YRU Still Here</em> (Noise)</strong> Angry personalized protest music with a super-sophisticated studio approach. The content aside, there’s some great production here; the vocal mix on “Pennsylvania 6 6666,” for instance, is very <em>What’s Going On</em> Marvin Gaye (not that Mark Ribot and Shahzad Ismaily have voices like Marvin Gaye in the least but you will get the idea).</p>
<p><strong>Steve Coleman and Five Elements, <em>Live At the Village Vanguard Volume 1: The Embedded </em><em>Sets </em>(Pi)</strong> First time in a long time that a record from this genuine contemporary jazz hero — an engaging and inventive composer, player, and particularly here, bandleader — has grabbed me so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Cyrille, <em>Lebroba</em> (ECM)</strong> The master drummer with guitarist Bill Frisell and trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith. Rich, deep stuff that gets richer and deeper with each listen. The way the players respond to each other in these unhurried but sometimes spectacularly intricate meditations is a privilege to earwitness.</p>
<p><strong>DKV Trio, <em>Latitude 41.88 </em>(NOTTWG)</strong> Quicksilver free jazz spectacle with soul; bleating, blaring, honking from Ken Vandermark on the reeds, tumbling gymnastics from drummer Hamid Drake, a racing pulse from Kent Kessler on bass. Unlike a trio like Air, which sometimes made you think you were listening to something wholly other than what they were, this unit specializes in restless but non-metamorphic invention.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Drumm, <em>Inexplicable Hours</em> (Sonoris)</strong> Electronic drones, field recordings, and other like materials make for a collection of wary quietude.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Eisenberg, <em>The Machinic Unconscious</em> (Tzadik)</strong> Inner Space Power Trio Extraordinaire: guitarist Eisenberg is joined by Trevor Dunn on bass and Ches Smith on drums. Lot and lots of what Beefheart called “nerve” guitar. Gratingly cool.</p>
<p><strong>Jurg Frey, <em>120 Pieces of Sound </em>(Elsewhere)</strong> The new label Elsewhere, founded by Yuko Zama, has a close affiliation with Erstwhile, and here it issues a sort-of sequel to Frey’s epic composition “l’ame est sans retenue,” released on a multi-disc set on Erst back in 2017. That piece is a lesson in both hearing and listening. This one-disc presentation is a trifle less daunting — the title track’s pieces are individual chords held for short durations, struck by a small ensemble and surrounded by silences. It’s both haltingly beautiful and peculiarly charming.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Frisell, <em>Music Is</em> (Okeh)</strong> A superb solo guitar collection, replete with loops and some little touches of that Line 6 DL 4 box that Mary Halvorson gives such a workout to…all BF compositions, some of them very vintage indeed. A friendly record, but not a complacent one, one into which he pours almost the entirety of what he knows as a jazz player into a sound that lays down a bed of impressionism atop which he improvises with a clean, precise attack.</p>
<p><strong>Satoko Fujii/Joe Fonda, <em>Mizu</em> (Long Song)</strong> Protean piano/bass improvisations: searching, energetic, tense and exuberant.</p>
<p><strong>Gosta Berlings Saga, <em>Et Ex</em> (Sony)</strong> Swedish post-prog combo that’s more Univers Zero that Jaga Jazzist but nevertheless very snappy with a varied tonal palette and some guest METAL DUDE vocals.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Halvorson &amp; Bill Frisell, <em>The Maid With The Flaxen Hair, A Tribute To Johnny</em> Smith (Tzadik)</strong> Lyrical, loving and a little cockeyed.</p>
<p><strong>Harriet Tubman, <em>The Terror End Of Beauty </em>(Sunnyside)</strong> The title track could be Pharoah Sanders sitting one out during the recording sessions for <em>Ask The Ages</em>. On the other tunes, though, guitarist Brandon Ross evokes McLaughlin and Sharrock, as <a href="https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/59xy4n/robert-christgau-on-jazz-rock-staple-harriet-tubman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Christgau says</a>. Although I think he does so &#0160;without ever sounding too much like either of them. Bassist Melvin Gibbs of course is Melvin Gibbs. Drummer JT Lewis is…well, the whole band is three bold players being their own selves and kicking against the pricks.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Kaiser, <em>The Deep Unreal: Solo Guitar 2017</em> (Metalanguage)</strong> Beyond mad-scientist virtuosity, beyond assault-with-intent on conventional guitar language, Kaiser is now a peerless creator of aural narrative. The first track, one of three that go over 20 minutes, is called “The Story of My 2017 Austral Spring At The McMudo Intake Jetty” and it is that story. The final, fourth track is less than three minutes and called “First You Fall In Love With Antarctica And Then It Breaks Your Heart”</p>
<p><strong>Henry Kaiser/Max Kutner, <em>Wild Courses </em>(Iluso)</strong> This double-twelve-string excursion may be my favorite Kaiser duet record since…could it be…<em>With Friends Like These</em>, the stunning 1979 first summit with Fred Frith?</p>
<p><strong>Manna/Mirage, <em>Rest of the World</em> (New House)</strong> Old school down to earth Maryland art rock in opposition.</p>
<p><strong>The Necks, <em>Body</em> (Northern Spy)</strong> Starts out like a regular Necks record…that steady pulse and hum and percolation…then…oh hell, I don’t want to spoil the wonderful surprise a little over 20 minutes in.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Seabrook Trio,<em> Convulsionaries </em>(Monofonous Press)</strong> Rather than a bassist and drummer, BS’s trio comprises as bassist and cellist — hey, just like Don Shirley! Seabrook’s playing sometimes evokes Derek Bailey going through Sharrock’s amp. Lotta banging for a record with no percussion. Definitely bracing. &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Soft Machine, <em>Hidden Details </em>(MoonJune)</strong> In which the formation long known as Soft Machine Legacy drops the “Legacy,” because they’ve earned the right to. Tricky, not too tricky, lots of exemplary playing, cool and a little hot. Caught them at Iridium in October during what will likely be their last tour, and they were splendid.</p>
<p><strong>Tyshawn Sorey, <em>Pillars </em>(Firehouse 12)</strong> An unusual series of sonic events. Where Henry Threadgill’s work (see below) highlights rhythmic MOVEMENT, this long piece (about four hours on three CDs), as its title suggests, encompasses playing within stasis, or as much stasis as the passing of time itself affords/allows, which is, paradoxically, none. The music then intends, among other things, to wrestle with that paradox.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Thelen, <em>Fractal Guitar</em> (MoonJune)</strong> Just what the title makes it sound like. Lotsa intricate patterns, nifty atmosphere, ferociously detailed soloing (from the likes of David Torn and Henry Kaiser among others).</p>
<p><strong>Henry Threadgill, <em>Double Up/Dirt…and More Dirt </em>(Pi)</strong> Two different ensembles, two different ideas. Double Up deals with sound in unmitigated and unapologetic motion, parallel lines of notes running at different speeds, anecdotes in rhythm.<em> Dirt </em>conveys a rather different sense of motion, like pages of a book turning.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbscrew, <em>Theirs/Ours </em>(Cuneiform)</strong> The protean trio (Mary Halvorson on guitar, Michael Formanek on bass, Tomas Fujiwara on drums) released a set of other people’s tunes and a set of their own tunes. Lots of super deep cuts on <em>Theirs</em>, and somewhat surprisingly (although I couldn’t tell you exactly why) nothing even resembling a pop nod or move. The least obscure is Wayne Shorter’s “Dance Cadaverous.” (My only complaint is that the CD artwork/design makes the song list hard to read.) On O<em>urs</em> MH’s compositions and performances provide melodic juice and sonic character; she’s playing guitar just like a-ringing a bell that goes a bit funny sometimes. Formanek grounds things while Fujiwara floats like a butterfly while flirting with what seems to be a rock backbeat. Neat stuff. Formanek’s compositions are a little more wide-open spaces, while Fujiwara’s are postcards from walking/waking dreams</p>
<p><strong>Mark Turner/ Ethan Iverson, <em>Temporary Kings</em> (ECM)</strong> Tenor and piano duets (mostly). Delicacy, sensitivity, dialogue both dramatic and humorous</p>
<p><strong>Dan Weiss, <em>Starebaby</em> (Pi)</strong> Intricate and heavy, a beguiling mix of acoustic and amplified timbres (two keybs, often but not always electric, bass and guitar always electric, drummer/leader who plays loud). &#0160;Knotty and ominous but never oppressive. Jazz-rock of a sort that can sound menacing and playful simultaneously.</p>
